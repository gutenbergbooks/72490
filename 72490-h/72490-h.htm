<p>When Mr. Bagehot spoke his luminous
words about “a fatigued
way of looking at great subjects,” he
gave us the key to a mental attitude
which perhaps is not the modern thing
it seems. There were, no doubt, Greeks
and Romans in plenty to whom the
“glory” and the “grandeur” of Greece
and Rome were less exhilarating than
they were to Edgar Poe,—Greeks and
Romans who were spiritually palsied
by the great emotions which presumably
accompany great events. They
may have been philosophers, or humanitarians,
or academists. They may have
been conscientious objectors, or conscienceless
shirkers, or perhaps plain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
men and women with a natural gift of
indecision, a natural taste for compromise
and awaiting developments. In the
absence of newspapers and pamphlets,
these peaceful pagans were compelled to
express their sense of fatigue to their
neighbours at the games or in the
market-place; and their neighbours—if
well chosen—sighed with them over the
intensity of life, the formidable happenings
of history.</p>

<p>Since August, 1914, the turmoil and
anguish incidental to the world’s greatest
war have accentuated every human
type,—heroic, base, keen, and evasive.
The strain of five years’ fighting was
borne with astounding fortitude, and
Allied statesmen and publicists saw to
it that the clear outline of events should
not be blurred by ignorance or misrepresentation.
If history in the making be a
fluid thing, it swiftly crystallizes. Men,
“living between two eternities, and
warring against oblivion,” make their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
indelible record on its pages; and other
men receive these pages as their best
inheritance, their avenue to understanding,
their key to life.</p>

<p>Therefore it is unwise to gibe at history
because we do not chance to know
it. It pleases us to gibe at anything we
do not know, but the process is not enlightening.
In the second year of the
war, the English “Nation” commented
approvingly on the words of an English
novelist who strove to make clear that
the only things which count for any of
us, individually or collectively, are the
unrecorded minutiæ of our lives. “History,”
said this purveyor of fiction, “is
concerned with the rather absurd and
theatrical doings of a few people, which,
after all, have never altered the fact
that we do all of us live on from day to
day, and only want to be let alone.”</p>

<p>“These words,” observed the “Nation”
heavily, “have a singular truth
and force at the present time. The people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
of Europe want to go on living, not
to be destroyed. To live is to pursue the
activities proper to one’s nature, to be
unhindered and unthwarted in their
exercise. It is not too much to say that
the life of Europe is something which
has persisted in spite of the history of
Europe. There is nothing happy or
fruitful anywhere but witnesses to the
triumph of life over history.”</p>

<p>Presuming that we are able to disentangle
life from history, to sever the
inseverable, is this a true statement, or
merely the expression of mental and
spiritual fatigue? Were the great historic
episodes invariably fruitless, and
had they no bearing upon the lives of
ordinary men and women? The battles
of Marathon and Thermopylæ, the
signing of the Magna Charta, the Triple
Alliance, the Declaration of Independence,
the birth of the National Assembly,
the first Reform Bill, the recognition
in Turin of the United Kingdom of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
Italy,—these things may have been
theatrical, inasmuch as they were certainly
dramatic, but absurd is not a
wise word to apply to them. Neither is
it possible to believe that the life of
Europe went on in spite of these historic
incidents, triumphing over them as over
so many obstacles to activity.</p>

<p>When the “Nation” contrasts the
beneficent companies of strolling players
who “represented and interpreted
the world of life, the one thing which
matters and remains,” with the companies
of soldiers who merely destroyed
life at its roots, we cannot but feel that
this editorial point of view has its limitations.
The strolling players of Elizabeth’s
day afforded many a merry hour;
but Elizabeth’s soldiers and sailors did
their part in making possible this mirth.
The strolling players who came to the
old Southwark Theatre in Philadelphia
interpreted “the world of life,” as they
understood it; but the soldiers who froze<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
at Valley Forge offered a different interpretation,
and one which had considerably
more stamina. The magnifying of
small things, the belittling of great ones,
indicate a mental exhaustion which
would be more pardonable if it were less
complacent. There are always men and
women who prefer the triumph of evil,
which is a thing they can forget, to prolonged
resistance, which shatters their
nerves. But the desire to escape an obligation,
while very human, is not generally
thought to be humanity’s noblest
lesson.</p>

<p>Many smart things have been written
to discredit history. Mr. Arnold called
it “the vast Mississippi of falsehood,”
which was easily said, and has been said
in a number of ways since the days of
Herodotus, who amply illustrated the
splendours of unreality. Mr. Edward
Fitzgerald was wont to sigh that only
lying histories are readable, and this
point of view has many secret adherents.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
Mr. Henry Adams, who taught
history for seven years at Harvard, and
who built his intellectual dwelling-place
upon its firm foundations, pronounced
it to be “in essence incoherent and immoral.”
Nevertheless, all that we know
of man’s unending efforts to adjust and
readjust himself to the world about him
we learn from history, and the tale is
an enlightening one. “Events are wonderful
things,” said Lord Beaconsfield.
Nothing, for example, can blot out, or
obscure, the event of the French Revolution.
We are free to discuss it until
the end of time; but we can never alter
it, and never get away from its consequences.</p>

<p>The lively contempt for history expressed
by readers who would escape
its weight, and the neglect of history
practised by educators who would escape
its authority, stand responsible for
much mental confusion. American boys
and girls go to school six, eight, or ten<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
years, as the case may be, and emerge
with a misunderstanding of their own
country, and a comprehensive ignorance
of all others. They say, “I don’t
know any history,” as casually and as
unconcernedly as they might say, “I
don’t know any chemistry,” or “I don’t
know metaphysics.” A smiling young
freshman in the most scholarly of women’s
colleges told me that she had been
conditioned because she knew nothing
about the Reformation.</p>

<p>“You mean,—” I began questioningly.</p>

<p>“I mean just what I say,” she interrupted.
“I didn’t know what it was, or
where it was, or who had anything to do
with it.”</p>

<p>I said I didn’t wonder she had come
to grief. The Reformation was something
of an episode. And I asked myself
wistfully how it happened she had ever
managed to escape it. When I was a
little schoolgirl, a pious Roman Catholic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
child with a distaste for polemics, it
seemed to me I was never done studying
about the Reformation. If I escaped
briefly from Wycliffe and Cranmer and
Knox, it was only to be met by Luther
and Calvin and Huss. Everywhere the
great struggle confronted me, everywhere
I was brought face to face with
the inexorable logic of events. That
more advanced and more intelligent
students find pleasure in every phase of
ecclesiastical strife is proved by Lord
Broughton’s pleasant story about a
member of Parliament named Joliffe,
who was sitting in his club, reading
Hume’s “History of England,” a book
which well deserves to be called dry.
Charles Fox, glancing over his shoulder,
observed, “I see you have come to the
imprisonment of the seven bishops”;
whereupon Joliffe, like a man engrossed
in a thrilling detective story, cried desperately,
“For God’s sake, Fox, don’t
tell me what is coming!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p>This was reading for human delight,
for the interest and agitation which are
inseparable from every human document.
Mr. Henry James once told me
that the only reading of which he never
tired was history. “The least significant
footnote of history,” he said, “stirs me
more than the most thrilling and passionate
fiction. Nothing that has ever
happened to the world finds me indifferent.”
I used to think that ignorance of
history meant only a lack of cultivation
and a loss of pleasure. Now I am sure
that such ignorance impairs our judgment
by impairing our understanding,
by depriving us of standards, of the
power to contrast, and the right to estimate.
We can know nothing of any nation
unless we know its history; and we
can know nothing of the history of any
nation unless we know something of the
history of all nations. The book of the
world is full of knowledge we need to
acquire, of lessons we need to learn, of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
wisdom we need to assimilate. Consider
only this brief sentence of Polybius,
quoted by Plutarch: “In Carthage no
one is blamed, however he may have
gained his wealth.” A pleasant place, no
doubt, for business enterprise; a place
where young men were taught how to
get on, and extravagance kept pace with
shrewd finance. A self-satisfied, self-confident,
money-getting, money-loving
people, honouring success, and hugging
their fancied security, while in far-off
Rome Cato pronounced their doom.</p>

<p>There are readers who can tolerate
and even enjoy history, provided it is
shorn of its high lights and heavy shadows,
its heroic elements and strong impelling
motives. They turn with relief
to such calm commentators as Sir John
Seeley, for years professor of modern
history at Cambridge, who shrank as
sensitively as an eighteenth-century
divine from that fell word “enthusiasm,”
and from all the agitation it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
gathers in its wake. He was a firm upholder
of the British Empire, hating
compromise and guiltless of pacifism;
but, having a natural gift for aridity,
he saw no reason why the world should
not be content to know things without
feeling them, should not keep its eyes
turned to legal institutions, its mind
fixed upon political economy and international
law. The force that lay back
of Parliament annoyed him by the simple
primitive way in which it beat
drums, fired guns, and died to uphold
the institutions which he prized; also
because by doing these things it evoked
in others certain simple and primitive
sensations which he strove always to
keep at bay. “We are rather disposed
to laugh,” he said, “when poets and
orators try to conjure us with the name
of England.” Had he lived a few years
longer, he would have known that England’s
salvation lies in the fact that her
name is, to her sons, a thing to conjure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
by. We may not wisely ignore the
value of emotions, nor underestimate
the power of the human impulses which
charge the souls of men.</p>

<p>The long years of neutrality engendered
in the minds of Americans a natural
but ignoble weariness. The war was
not our war, yet there was no escaping
from it. By day and night it haunted us,
a ghost that would not be laid. Over and
over again we were told that it was not
possible to place the burden of blame on
any nation’s shoulders. Once at least
we were told that the causes and objects
of the contest, the obscure fountains
from which had burst this stupendous
and desolating flood, were no concern
of ours. But this proffered release from
serious thinking brought us scant peace
of mind. Every honest man and woman
knew that we had no intellectual right
to be ignorant when information lay at
our hand, and no spiritual right to be
unconcerned when great moral issues<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
were at stake. We could not in either
case evade the duty we owed to reason.
The Vatican Library would not hold the
books that have been written about the
war; but the famous five-foot shelf
would be too roomy for the evidence in
the case, the documents which are the
foundation of knowledge. They, at least,
are neither too profuse for our patience,
nor too complex for our understanding.
“The inquiry into the truth or falsehood
of a matter of history,” said Huxley,
“is just as much an affair of pure science
as is the inquiry into the truth or falsehood
of a matter of geology; and the
value of the evidence in the two cases
must be tested in the same way.”</p>

<p>The resentment of American pacifists,
who, being more human than they
thought themselves, were no better able
than the rest of us to forget the state of
Europe, found expression in petulant
complaints. They kept reminding us at
inopportune moments that war is not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
the important and heroic thing it is assumed
to be. They asked that, if it is to
figure in history at all (which seems, on
the whole, inevitable), the truth should
be told, and its brutalities, as well as its
heroisms, exposed. They professed a
languid amusement at the “rainbow of
official documents” which proved every
nation in the right. They inveighed bitterly
against the “false patriotism”
taught by American schoolbooks, with
their absurd emphasis on the “embattled
farmers” of the Revolution, and
the volunteers of the Civil War. They
assured us, in and out of season, that a
doctor who came to his death looking
after poor patients in an epidemic was
as much of a hero as any soldier whose
grave is yearly decorated with flowers.</p>

<p>All this was the clearest possible exposition
of the lassitude induced in faint-hearted
men by the pressure of great
events. It was the wail of people who
wanted, as the “Nation” feelingly expressed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
it, to be let alone, and who could
not shut themselves away from the
world’s great tragedy. None of us are
prepared to say that a doctor and a
nurse who perform their perilous duties
in an epidemic are not as heroic as a
doctor and a nurse who perform their
perilous duties in war. There is glory
enough to go around. Only he that loveth
his life shall lose it. But to put a
flower on a soldier’s grave is a not too
exuberant recognition of his service, for
he, too, in his humble way made the
great sacrifice.</p>

<p>As for the brutalities of war, who can
charge that history smooths them over?
Certain horrors may be withheld from
children, whose privilege it is to be
spared the knowledge of uttermost depravity;
but to the adult no such mercy
is shown. Motley, for example, describes
cruelties committed three hundred and
fifty years ago in the Netherlands, which
equal, if they do not surpass, the cruelties<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
committed six years ago in Belgium.
Men heard such tales more calmly
then than now, and seldom sought the
coward’s refuge—incredulity. The
Dutch, like other nations, did better
things than fight. They painted glorious
pictures, they bred great statesmen and
good doctors. They traded with extraordinary
success. They raised the most
beautiful tulips in the world. But to do
these things peacefully and efficiently,
they had been compelled to struggle for
their national existence. The East India
trade and the freedom of the seas did
not drop into their laps. And because
their security, and the comeliness of
life which they so highly prized, had
been bought by stubborn resistance to
tyranny, they added to material well-being
the “luxury of self-respect.”</p>

<p>To overestimate the part played by
war in a nation’s development is as
crude as to ignore its alternate menace
and support. It is with the help of history<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
that we balance our mental accounts.
Voltaire was disposed to think
that battles and treaties were matters
of small moment; and Mr. John Richard
Green pleaded, not unreasonably,
that more space should be given in our
chronicles to the missionary, the poet,
the painter, the merchant, and the
philosopher. They are not, and they
never have been, excluded from any
narrative comprehensive enough to admit
them; but the scope of their authority
is not always sufficiently defined.
Man, as the representative of his age,
and the events in which he plays his
vigorous part,—these are the warp and
woof of history. We can no more leave
John Wesley or Ignatius Loyola out of
the canvas than we can leave out Marlborough
or Pitt. We know now that the
philosophy of Nietzsche is one with
Bernhardi’s militarism.</p>

<p>As for the merchant,—Froissart was
as well aware of his prestige as was Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
Green. “Trade, my lord,” said Dinde
Desponde, the great Lombard banker,
to the Duke of Burgundy, “finds its
way everywhere, and rules the world.”
As for commercial honour,—a thing as
fine as the honour of the aristocrat or of
the soldier,—what can be better for
England than to know that after the
great fire of 1666 not a single London
shopkeeper evaded his liabilities; and
that this fact was long the boast of a city
proud of its shopkeeping? As for jurisprudence,—Sully
was infinitely more
concerned with it than he was with combat
or controversy. It is with stern satisfaction
that he recounts the statutes
passed in his day for the punishment of
fraudulent bankrupts, whom we treat
so leniently; for the annulment of their
gifts and assignments, which we guard
so zealously; and for the conviction of
those to whom such property had been
assigned. It was almost as dangerous to
steal on a large scale as on a small one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
under the levelling laws of Henry of
Navarre.</p>

<p>In this vast and varied chronicle, war
plays its appointed part. “We cannot,”
says Walter Savage Landor, “push
valiant men out of history.” We cannot
escape from the truths interpreted, and
the conditions established by their valour.
What has been slightingly called
the “drum-and-trumpet narrative”
holds its own with the records of art and
science. “It cost Europe a thousand
years of barbarism,” said Macaulay,
“to escape the fate of China.”</p>

<p>The endless endeavour of states to
control their own destinies, the ebb and
flow of the sea of combat, the “recurrent
liturgy of war,” enabled the old
historians to perceive with amazing distinctness
the traits of nations, etched as
sharply then as now on the imperishable
pages of history. We read Froissart for
human delight rather than for solid information;
yet Froissart’s observations—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
observations of a keen-eyed student
of the world—are worth recording
five hundred years after he set them
down.</p>

<p>“In England,” he says, “strangers
are well received”; yet are the English
“affable to no other nation than their
own.” Ireland, he holds to have had
“too many kings”; and the Scotch, like
the English, “are excellent men-at-arms,
nor is there any check to their
courage as long as their weapons endure.”
France is the pride of his heart,
as it is the pride of the world’s heart to-day.
“In France also is found good chivalry,
strong of spirit, and in great abundance;
for the kingdom of France has
never been brought so low as to lack
men ready for the combat.” Even Germany
does not escape his regard. “The
Germans are a people without pity and
without honour.” And again: “The
Germans are a rude, unmannered race,
but active and expert where their own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
personal advantage is concerned.” If
history be “philosophy teaching by example,”
we are wise to admit the old
historians into our counsels.</p>

<p>To withhold from a child some knowledge—apportioned
to his understanding—of
the world’s sorrows and wrongs
is to cheat him of his kinship with humanity.
We would not, if we could,
bruise his soul as our souls are bruised;
but we would save him from a callous
content which is alien to his immaturity.
The little American, like the little
Austrian and the little Serb, is a son of
the sorrowing earth. His security—of
which no man can forecast the future—is
a legacy bequeathed him by predecessors
who bought it with sweat and with
blood; and with sweat and with blood
his descendants may be called on to
guard it. Alone among educators, Mr.
G. Stanley Hall finds neutrality, a “high
and ideal neutrality,” to be an attribute
of youth. He was so gratified by this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
discovery during the years of the war,
so sure that American boys and girls
followed “impartially” the great struggle
in Europe, and that this judicial attitude
would, in the years to come, enable
them to pronounce “the true verdict of
history,” that he “thrilled and tingled”
with patriotic—if premature—pride.</p>

<p>“The true verdict of history” will be
pronounced according to the documentary
evidence in the case. There is no
need to vex our souls over the possible
extinction of this evidence, for closer
observers than our impartial young
Americans are placing it permanently
on record. But I doubt if the equanimity
which escapes the ordeal of partisanship
is to be found in the mind of youth,
or in the heart of a child. Can we not remember
a time when the Wars of the
Roses were not—to us—a matter for
neutrality? Our little school histories,
those vivacious, anecdotal histories,
banished long ago by rigorous educators,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
were in some measure responsible for
our Lancastrian fervour. They fed it
with stories of high courage and the sorrows
of princes. We wasted our sympathies
on “a mere struggle for power”;
but Hume’s laconic verdict is not, and
never can be, the measure of a child’s
solicitude. The lost cause fills him with
pity, the cause which is saved by man’s
heroic sacrifice fires him to generous applause.
The round world and the tale of
those who have lived upon it are his
legitimate inheritance.</p>

<p>Mr. Bagehot said, and said wisely
after his wont, that if you catch an intelligent,
uneducated man of thirty, and
tell him about the battle of Marathon,
he will calculate the chances, and estimate
the results; but he will not really
care. You cannot make the word “Marathon”
sound in his ears as it sounded
in the ears of Byron, to whom it had
been sacred in boyhood. You cannot
make the word “freedom” sound in untutored<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
ears as it sounds in the ears
of men who have counted the cost by
which it has been preserved through the
centuries. Unless children are permitted
to know the utmost peril which has
threatened, and which threatens, the
freedom of nations, how can they conceive
of its value? And what is the worth
of teaching which does not rate the gift
of freedom above all earthly benefactions?
How can justice live save by the
will of freemen? Of what avail are civic
virtues that are not the virtues of the
free? Pericles bade the Athenians to
bear reverently in mind the Greeks who
had died for Greece. “Make these men
your examples, and be well assured that
happiness comes by freedom, and freedom
by stoutness of heart.” Perhaps if
American boys bear reverently in mind
the men who died for America, it will
help them too to be stout of heart, and
“worthy patriots, dear to God.”</p>

<p>In the remote years of my childhood,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
the study of current events, that most
interesting and valuable form of tuition,
which, nevertheless, is unintelligible
without some knowledge of the past,
was left out of our limited curriculum.
We seldom read the newspapers (which
I remember as of an appalling dulness),
and we knew little of what was happening
in our day. But we did study history,
and we knew something of what
had happened in other days than ours;
we knew and deeply cared. Therefore
we reacted with fair intelligence and no
lack of fervour when circumstances were
forced upon our vision. It was not possible
for a child who had lived in spirit
with Saint Genevieve to be indifferent
to the siege of Paris in 1870. It is not
possible for a child who has lived in
spirit with Jeanne d’Arc to be indifferent
to the destruction of Rheims Cathedral
in 1914. If we were often left in
ignorance, we were never despoiled of
childhood’s generous ardour. Nobody<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
told us that “courage is a sublime form
of hypocrisy.” Nobody fed our young
minds on stale paradoxes, or taught us
to discount the foolish impulsiveness of
adults. Our parents, as Mr. Henry James
rejoicingly observes, “had no desire to
see us inoculated with importunate virtues.”
The Honourable Bertrand Russell
had not then proposed that all
teaching of history shall be submitted
to an “international commission,”
“which shall produce neutral text-books,
free from patriotic bias.” There
was something profoundly fearless in
our approach to life, in the exposure of
our unarmoured souls to the assaults of
enthusiasms and regrets.</p>

<p>The cynic who is impatient of primitive
emotions, the sentimentalist whose
sympathy is confined exclusively to his
country’s enemies, grow more shrill-voiced
as the exhaustion of Europe becomes
increasingly apparent. They were
always to be heard by those who paused<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
amid the thunderings of war to listen to
them; but their words were lost in the
whirlwind. It was possible for a writer
in the “Survey” to allude brutally in
the spring of 1916 to the “cockpit of
Verdun.” It was possible for Mr. Russell
to turn from the contemplation of
Ypres, and say: “The war is trivial for
all its vastness. No great human purpose
is involved on either side, no great
principle is at stake.” If the spiritual
fatigue of the looker-on had found an
echo in the souls of those who were
bearing the burden and heat of the day,
the world would have sunk to destruction.
“The moral triumph of Belgium,”
said Cardinal Mercier, when his country
had been conquered and despoiled,
“is an ever memorable fact for history
and civilization.” Who shall be the
spokesman of the future?</p>

<p>In the last melancholy pages of that
able and melancholy book, “The Economic
Consequences of the Peace,” Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
Keynes describes the apathy of victorious
England, too spent to savour victory.
“Our power of feeling or caring
beyond the immediate questions of our
own material well-being is temporarily
eclipsed. We have been moved already
beyond endurance, and need rest. Never,
in the lifetime of men now living, has
the universal element in the soul of man
burnt so dimly.”</p>

<p>Never perhaps in the centuries, for
when in the centuries has that element
been so ruthlessly consumed? England
is like a swimmer who has carried the
lifeline to shore, battling amid the
breakers, tossed high on their crests,
hurled into their green depths, pounded,
battered, blinded, until he lies, a broken
thing, on the shore. The crew is safe, but
until the breath comes back to his labouring
lungs, he is past all acute consideration
for its welfare. Were Mr.
Keynes generous enough to extend his
sympathy alike to foes and friends, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
might even now see light shining on the
horizon. It would do him—it would do
us all—good to meditate closely on the
probable state of Europe had Germany
triumphed. The “hidden currents” of
which we are warned may be sweeping
us on a reef; but the most imminent
and most appalling calamity has been
averted. “Events are wonderful things,”
and we may yet come to believe with
Froissart, lover of brave deeds and honourable
men, that “the most profitable
thing in the world for the institution of
human life is history.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Dead_Authors">Dead Authors</h2>
</div>


<p>“Les morts n’écrivent point,” said
Madame de Maintenon, who lived
in a day of tranquil finalities. If men’s
passions and vanities were admittedly
strong until the hour of dissolution, the
finger of death obliterated all traces of
them; and the supreme dignity of this
obliteration sustained noble minds and
solaced the souls that believed. An age
which produced the <i>Oraisons Funèbres</i>
had an unquenchable reverence for the
grave.</p>

<p>Echoes of Madame de Maintenon’s
soothing conviction ring pleasantly
through the intervening centuries. Book-making,
which she knew only in its smiling
infancy, had grown to ominous proportions
when the Hon. Augustine Birrell,
brooding over the fatality which
had dipped the world in ink, comforted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
himself—and us—with the vision of
an authorless future. “There were no
books in Eden,” he said meditatively,
“and there will be none in Heaven; but
between times it is otherwise.”</p>

<p>For an Englishman more or less conversant
with ghosts, Mr. Birrell showed
little foreknowledge of their dawning
ambitions. If we may judge by the recent
and determined intrusion of spirits
into authorship, Heaven bids fair to be
stacked with printing-presses. One of
their number, indeed, the “Living Dead
Man,” whose amanuensis is Elsa Barker,
and whose publishers have unhesitatingly
revealed (or, I might perhaps
say, announced) his identity, gives high
praise to a ghostly library, well catalogued,
and containing millions of books
and records. Miss Lilian Whiting assures
us that every piece of work done in life
has its ethereal counterpart. “The
artist creates in the astral before he creates
in the material, and the creation in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
the astral is the permanent embodiment.”
Consequently, when an author
dies, he finds awaiting him an “imperishable
record” of all he has ever written.
Miss Whiting does not tell us how
she comes to know this. Neither does
she say how good a book has to be to
live forever in the astral, or if a very bad
book is never suffered to die a natural and
kindly death as in our natural and kindly
world. Perhaps it is the ease with which
astral immortality is achieved, or rather
the impossibility of escaping it, which
prompts ambitious and exclusive spirits
to force an entrance into our congested
literary life, and compete with mortal
scribblers who ask their little day.</p>

<p>The suddenness of the attack, and its
unprecedented character, daunt and bewilder
us. It is true that the apparitions
that lend vivacity to the ordinary spiritualistic
séance have from time to time
written short themes, or dropped into
friendly verse. Readers of that engaging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
volume, “Report of the Seybert Commission
for Investigating Modern Spiritualism,”
published in 1887, will remember
that “Belle,” who claimed to be the
original proprietor of Yorick’s skull
(long a “property” of the Walnut Street
Theatre, Philadelphia, but at that time
in the library of Dr. Horace Howard
Furness), voiced her pretensions, and
told her story, in ten carefully rhymed
stanzas.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“My form was sold to doctors three,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So you have all that’s left of me;</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">You that prizes my lonely skull.”</div>
  </div>

</div>

<p>But these effusions were desultory and
amateurish. They were designed as personal
communications, and were betrayed
into publicity by their recipients.
We cannot regard their authors—painstaking
but simple-hearted ghosts—as
advance guards of the army of occupation
which is now storming the citadel
of print.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span></p>

<p>It is passing strange that the dead who
seek to communicate with the living
should cling so closely to the alphabet
as a connecting link. Dying is a primitive
thing. Men died, and were wept and
forgotten, for many, many ages before
Cadmus sowed the dragon’s teeth. But
letters are artificial and complicated.
They belong to fettered humanity
which is perpetually devising ways and
means. Shelley, whose impatient soul
fretted against barriers, cried out despairingly
that inspiration wanes when
composition begins. We strive to follow
Madame de Sévigné’s counsel, “Laissez
trotter la plume”; but we know well
how the little instrument halts and
stumbles; and if a pen is too clumsy for
the transmission of thought, what must
be the effort to pick out letters on
a ouija board, or with a tilting table?
The spirit that invented table-rapping
(which combines every possible disadvantage
as a means of communication<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
with every absurdity that can offend a
fastidious taste) deserves to be penalized
by its fellow spirits. Even Sir Oliver
Lodge admits that the substitution of
tables for pen and ink “has difficulties
of its own.”</p>

<p>Yet nothing can overcome the infatuation
of ghostly visitors for this particular
piece of furniture. They cannot keep
their spectral fingers off one, and they
will come any distance, and take any
pains, for the pleasure of such handling.
Maeterlinck relates with enviable gravity
the details of an evening call paid
by a monk who had lain in the cloisters
of the Abbaye de Saint Wandrille since
1693, and who broke a sleep of two centuries
that he might spin a table on one
leg for the diversion of the poet’s guests.
Their host, while profoundly indifferent
to the entertainment, accepted it with a
tolerant shrug. If it amused both mortals
and the monk, why cavil at its infantile
simplicity?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span></p>

<p>The frolicsome moods of the Lodge
table must have been disconcerting
even to such a receptive and sympathetic
circle. It performed little tricks
like lying down, or holding two feet in
the air, apparently for its own innocent
delight. It emulated Æsop’s affectionate
ass, and “seemed to wish to get into
Lady Lodge’s lap, and made caressing
movements to and fro, as if it could not
get close enough to her.” It jocularly
thumped piano-players on the back;
and when a cushion was held up to protect
them, it banged a hole in the cover.
What wonder that several tables were
broken “during the more exuberant
period of these domestic sittings, before
the power was under control”; and that
the family was compelled to provide a
strong and heavy article which could
stand the “skylarking” (Sir Oliver’s
word) of supernatural visitors.</p>

<p>The ouija board, though an improvement
on the table, is mechanical and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
cumbersome. It has long been the
chosen medium of that most prolific of
spirit writers, Patience Worth; and a
sympathetic disciple once ventured to
ask her if there were no less laborious
method by which she could compose her
stories. To which Patience, who then
used a language called by her editor
“archaic,” and who preferred to “dock
the smaller parts-o’-speech,” replied
formidably,—</p>

<p>“The hand o’ her do I to put be the
hand o’ her, and ’t is ascribe that setteth
the one awither by eyes-fulls she
taketh in.”</p>

<p>The disciple’s mind being thus set at
rest, he inquired how Patience discovered
this avenue of approach, and was
told,—</p>

<p>“I did to seek at crannies for to put; ay,
an’t wer the her o’ her who tireth past
the her o’ her, and slippeth to a naught
o’ putting; and ’t wer the me o’ me at
seek, aye, and find. Aye, and ’t wer so.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span></p>

<p>The casual and inexpert reader is not
always sure what Patience means to
say; but to the initiated her cryptic and
monosyllabic speech offers no difficulties.
When asked if she were acquainted
with the spirit of the late Dr. William
James, she said darkly,—</p>

<p>“I telled a one o’ the brothers and the
neighbours o’ thy day, and he doth
know.”</p>

<p>“This,” comments Mr. Yost, “was
considered as an affirmative reply,” and
with it her questioners were content.</p>

<p>All fields of literature are open to Patience
Worth, and she disports herself
by turns in prose and verse, fiction and
philosophy. Other spirits have their
specialties. They write, as a rule, letters,
sermons, didactic essays, <i>vers libre</i>, and
an occasional story. But Patience writes
six-act dramas which, we are assured,
could, “with a little alteration,” be
produced upon the stage, short comedies
“rich in humour,” country tales,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
mystical tales, parables, aphorisms,
volumes of verse, and historical novels.
In three years and a half she dictated
to Mrs. Curran, her patient ouija-board
amanuensis, 900,000 words. It is my
belief that she represents a spirit syndicate,
and lends her name to a large
coterie of literary wraiths. The most
discouraging feature of her performance
is the possibility of its indefinite extension.
She is what Mr. Yost calls “a
continuing phenomenon.” Being dead
already, she cannot die, and the beneficent
limit which is set to mortal endeavour
does not exist for her. “The larger
literature is to come,” says Mr. Yost
ominously; and we fear he speaks the
truth.</p>

<p>Now what do we gain by this lamentable
intrusion of ghostly aspirants into
the serried ranks of authorship? What is
the value of their work, and what is its
ethical significance? Perhaps because
literary distinction is a rare quality, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
editors and publishers of these revelations
lay stress upon the spiritual insight,
the finer wisdom, which may
accrue to us from direct contact with
liberated souls. They even hint at some
great moral law which may be thus revealed
for our betterment. But the law
of Christ is as pure and lofty as any
code our human intelligence can grasp.
We do not live by it, because it makes
no concession to the sickly qualities
which cement our earthly natures; but
we hold fast to it as an incomparable
ideal. It is not law or light we need. It
is the power of effort and resistance.
“Toutes les bonnes maximes sont dans
le monde; on ne manque que de les appliquer.”</p>

<p>The didacticism of spirit authors is, so
far, their most striking characteristic.
As Mr. Henry James would put it, they
are “awkward writers, but yearning
moralists.” Free from any shadow of
diffidence, they proffer a deal of counsel,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
but it is mostly of the kind which our
next-door neighbour has at our command.</p>

<p>In the volume called “Letters from
Harry and Helen,” the dead children
exhort their relatives continuously; and
their exhortations, albeit of a somewhat
intimate character, have been
passed on to the public as “an inspiration
to the life of brotherhood.” Helen,
for example, bids her mother and sister
give away the clothes they do not need.
“You had better send the pink dress to
B. You won’t wear it. Lace and a few
good bits of jewelry you can use, and
these won’t hurt your progress.” She
also warns them not to take long motor
rides with large parties. The car holds
four comfortably; but if her sister <i>will</i>
go all afternoon with five people packed
into it, she is sure to be ill. This is sensible
advice, but can it be needful that
the dead should revisit earth to give it?</p>

<p>Harry, a hardy and boisterous spirit,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
with a fine contempt for precautions,
favours a motor trip across the continent,
gallantly assures his family that
the project is “perfectly feasible,” tells
his sister to “shoot some genuine food”
at her sick husband, who appears to
have been kept on a low diet, and observes
with pleasure that his mother is
overcoming her aversion to tobacco.
“Mamma is learning,” he comments
patronizingly. “Some day she will arrive
at the point where a smoker will fail to
arouse a spark of criticism, or even of
interest. <i>When that day comes, she will
have learned what she is living for this
time.</i>”</p>

<p>Here was a chance for a ghostly son to
get even with the parent who had disparaged
the harmless pleasures of his
youth. Harry is not the kind of a spirit
to miss such an opportunity. He finds
a great deal to correct in his family, a
great deal to blame in the world, and
some things to criticize in the universe.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
“I suppose the Creator knows his own
business best,” he observes grudgingly;
“but there have been moments when
I felt I could suggest improvements.
For instance, had I been running affairs,
I should have been a little more open
about this reincarnation plan of elevating
the individual. Why let a soul boggle
along blindly for numberless lives,
when just a friendly tip would have
illuminated the whole situation, and
enabled him to plan with far less
waste?”</p>

<p>“O eloquent, just and mighty death!”
Have we professed to break thy barriers,
to force thy pregnant silence into
speech, only to make of thy majesty a
vulgar farce, and, of thy consolations,
folly and self-righteousness?</p>

<p>The “Living Dead Man” has also a
course of instruction, in fact several
courses of instruction, to offer. His
counsels are all of the simplest. He bids
us drink plenty of water, because water<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
feeds our astral bodies; to take plenty of
sleep, because sleep fits us for work; and
on no account to lose our tempers. He is
a gentle, garrulous ghost, and his first
volume is filled with little anecdotes
about his new—and very dull—surroundings,
and mild little stories of adventure.
He calls himself an “astral
Scheherazade,” but no sultan would
ever have listened to him for a thousand
and one nights. He chants <i>vers libre</i> of a
singularly uninspired order, and is particular
about his quotations. “If you
print these letters,” he tells his medium,
“I wish you would insert here fragments
from that wonderful poem of Wordsworth,
‘Intimations of Immortality
from Recollections of Early Childhood.’”
Then follow nineteen lines of
this fairly familiar masterpiece. There
is something rather droll in having our
own printed poets quoted to us lengthily
by cultivated and appreciative spirits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span></p>

<p>The “War Letters” dictated by the
“Living Dead Man” in the spring and
summer of 1915 are more animated and
highly coloured. Some long-past episodes,
notably the entrance of the German
soldiers into Brussels, are well described,
though not so vividly as by the
living Richard Harding Davis. We are
told in the preface that on the fourth
of February, 1915, the spirit wrote:
“When I come back” (he was touring
to a distant star), “and tell you the
story of this war, as seen from the other
side, you will know more than all the
Chancelleries of the nations.” This
promises well; but in the three hundred
pages that follow there is not one word
to indicate that the “Living Dead
Man” had any acquaintance with real
happenings which were not published
in our newspapers; or that he was aware
of these happenings before the newspapers
published them. He is always on
the safe side of prophecy. In a letter dictated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
on the seventh of May, the date of
the sinking of the Lusitania, he makes no
mention of the crime; but the following
morning, after the ghastly news was
known to the world, he writes that he
could have told it twenty-four hours
earlier had he not feared to shock Mrs.
Barker’s sensibilities.</p>

<p>It was a mistaken kindness. Nothing
could save mankind from a knowledge
of that terrible deed; but four words
spoken on the seventh of May would
have revolutionized the world of
thought. They would have compelled
belief in phenomena which we are now
intellectually free to reject.</p>

<p>The events narrated by the “Living
Dead Man” are of a kind which the
Chancelleries of the nations had no
need to know. He tells us that he and
twenty other spirits stood for hours in
the palace of Potsdam, trying with lamentable
lack of success to reduce by
the pressure of their will the greater<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
pressure of the war-will surging through
the German nation. He has a dramatic
meeting with the spirit of the murdered
Archduke, Franz Ferdinand, and a long
interview with the spirit of Nietzsche,
whom he commands—authoritatively—to
go back to earth and teach humility.
He rests and refreshes the jaded
spirit of a British officer, killed in action,
by showing him a dance of sylphs;
and he meets an old acquaintance, the
sylph Meriline (friend and familiar of
a French magician), doing scout duty
in the German trenches. Finally he
assures us that Serbia is doomed to disaster,
because a Serbian magician, who
died many years ago, left her as a legacy
a host of “astral monsters” that infest
the land, awakening from slumber at the
first hint of strife, and revelling in
bloodshed and misery.</p>

<p>It is hard lines on Serbia, and it
sounds a good deal like the fairy tales of
our happy infancy. The “Living Dead<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
Man” is careful to let us know that he
has assisted at the war councils of Berlin,
being enabled by an especial hardening
of the astral ears to hear all that
is spoken on earth. No secrets of state
are hidden from him; but, on such
weighty matters, discretion compels silence.
Moreover, the vastness of his
knowledge is out of accord with the
puniness of our intelligence. It cannot
be communicated, because there is no
avenue of approach. “The attempt to
tell the world what I know now is like
trying to play Beethoven on a penny
whistle. I feel as a mathematician would
feel should he set himself down to teach
addition to small children. I dare not
tell you more than I do, for you could
not contain it.”</p>

<p>And so we are told nothing.</p>

<p>In the little book entitled, “Thy
Son Liveth,” which is said to have been
dictated by an American soldier, killed
in Flanders, to his mother, we have a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
cheerful picture of active young spirits
“carrying on” the business of war, relieving
the wounded, soothing the dying,
working up wireless communications
(“The German operators cannot
see us when we are around”), and occasionally
playing the part of the gods
before the walls of Troy.</p>

<p>“I told you that we were not given
any power over bullets, that we can
comfort, but not save from what you
call death. That is not quite the case,
I find. Jack Wells directed me to stand
by a junior lieutenant to-day, and impel
him this way and that to avoid
danger. I discovered that my perceptions
are much more sensitive than they
were before I came out. I can estimate
the speed, and determine the course, of
shells. I stood by this fellow, nudged him
here and there, and kept him from being
hurt. I asked Wells if that was an answer
to prayer. Wells said, ‘No, the
young chap is an inventor, and has a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
job ahead of him that’s of importance
to the world.’”</p>

<p>It is an interesting episode; but intervention,
as we learn from Homer, is an
open game. Perhaps some German lieutenant
had a job ahead of <i>him</i>, and scientifically-minded
German ghosts saved
him from Allied shells. When the dead
American soldier writes that he is going
to “get in touch with Edison,” and
work on devices to combat German
machines, we ask ourselves whether
dead German soldiers got in touch with
Dr. Haber, and helped him make the
poison gas and the flame-throwers
which won the Nobel prize.</p>

<p>That the son should proffer much
good advice to his mother seems inevitable,
because it is the passion of all
communicative spirits to advise. He is
also happy to correct certain false impressions
which she has derived from
the Evangelists.</p>

<p>“I got your wire calling my attention<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
to the scriptural statement that in Heaven
there is neither marriage nor giving
in marriage, and I do not know what to
say. It seemed (until you gave me this
jolt) that the Bible bears out everything
that I have been able to tell you.
Perhaps the chronicler got balled up in
this particular quotation. For love and
marriage are certainly in bud and flower
here. I can see this fact with my own
eyes.”</p>

<p>He can do more than see it with his
own eyes. He can feel it with his own
heart. A few pages later comes this
naïve confession:</p>

<p>“Jack Wells and I are very close
friends. His sister’s name is Alice, and
she has grown up in the country beyond,
where his folks live. It seems all reach
or return to maturity. Youth blossoms
and flowers, but does not decay. I can
call up her vision at any time. But I
want her near.”</p>

<p>A simple and guileless little book, preposterous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
only in the assumption that
the human race has waited for centuries
to receive its revelations.</p>

<p>We have been told that the Great War
stands responsible for our mental disturbance,
for the repeated assaults upon
taste and credulity before which the
walls of our minds are giving way. Mr.
Howells, observing rather sympathetically
the ghostly stir and thrill which
pervades literature, asked if it were
due to the overwhelming numbers of
the dead, if it came to us straight from
sunken ships, and from the battle-fields
of Europe.</p>

<p>What answer can we make save that
natural laws work independently of circumstance?
A single dead man and a
million of dead men stand in the same
relation to the living. If ever there was
a time when it was needful to hold on
to our sanity with all our might, that
time is now. Our thoughts turn, and will
long turn, to the men who laid down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
their lives for our safety. How could it
be otherwise? There is, and there has
always been, a sense of comradeship
with the departed. It is a noble and a
still comradeship, untarnished by illusions,
unvulgarized by extravagant details.
Newman has portrayed it in “A
Voice from Afar”; and Mr. Rowland
Thirlmere has made it the theme of
some very simple and touching verses
called “Jimmy Doane.” The elderly
Englishman who has lost his friend, a
young American aviator, “generous,
clever, and confident,” and who sits
alone, with his heart cold and sore, feels
suddenly the welcome nearness of the
dead. No table heaves its heavy legs to
announce that silent presence. No alphabet
is needed for his message. But the
living man says simply to his friend,
“My house is always open to you,” and
hopes that they may sit quietly together
when the dreams of both are realized,
and the hour of deliverance comes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span></p>

<p>The attitude of spirit authors to the
war varies from the serene detachment
of Raymond, who had been a soldier,
to the passionate partisanship of the
“Living Dead Man,” who had been a
civilian; but who, like the anonymous
“Son,” cannot refrain from playing a
lively part in the struggle. “Many a
time have I clutched with my too-tenuous
hands a German soldier who was
about to disgrace himself.” Harry and
Helen express some calm regret that
the lack of unselfish love should make
war possible, and report that “Hughey”—their
brother-in-law’s brother—“has
gone to throw all he possesses of light
into the dark struggle.” Apparently his
beams failed signally to illuminate the
gloom, which is not surprising when
we learn that “a selfish or ill-natured
thought” (say from a Bulgarian or a
Turk) “lowers the rate of vibration
throughout the entire universe.” They
also join the “White Cross” nurses, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
are gratified that their knowledge of
French enables them to receive and encourage
the rapidly arriving French soldiers.
Helen, being the better scholar of
the two, is able to give first aid, while
Harry brushes up his verbs. In the absence
of French caretakers, who seem
to have all gone elsewhere, the two
young Americans are in much demand.</p>

<p>Remote from such crass absurdities
(which have their confiding readers)
is the quiet, if somewhat perfunctory,
counsel given by “The Invisible Guide”
to Mr. C. Lewis Hind, and by him transmitted
to the public. There is nothing
offensive or distasteful in this little volume
which has some charming chapters,
and which purports to be an answer to
the often asked question, “How may
I enter into communion with the departed?”
If the admonitions of the dead
soldier, who is the “Guide,” lack pith
and marrow, they do not lack it more
perceptibly than do the admonitions of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
living counsellors, and he is always commendably
brief. What depresses us is
the quality of his pacifism expressed at
a time which warranted the natural and
noble anger awakened by injustice.</p>

<p>It is the peculiarity of all pacifists
that wrongdoing disturbs them less than
does the hostility it provokes. The
“Guide” has not a sigh to waste over
Belgium and Serbia. Air-raids and submarines
fail to disturb his serenity. But
he cannot endure a picture called <i>Mitrailleuse</i>,
which represents four French
soldiers firing a machine gun. When his
friend, the author, so far forgets himself
as to be angry at the insolence of some
Germans, the “Guide,” pained by such
intolerance, refuses any communication;
and when, in more cheerful mood,
the author ventures to be a bit enthusiastic
over the gallant feats of a young
aviator, the “Guide” murmurs faintly
and reproachfully, “It is the mothers
that suffer.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span></p>

<p>One is forced to doubt if guidance such
as this would ever have led to victory.</p>

<p>Raymond, though he has been thrust
before the public without pity and without
reserve, has shown no disposition to
enter the arena of authorship. He has
been content to prattle to his own family
about the conditions that surround
him, about the brick house he lives in,
the laboratories he visits, where “all
sorts of things” are manufactured out
of “essences and ether and gases,”—rather
like German war products, and
the lectures that he attends. The subjects
of these lectures are spirituality,
concentration, and—alas!—“the projection
of uplifting and helpful thoughts
to those on the earth plane.” Such
scraps of wisdom as are vouchsafed him
he passes dutifully on to his parents.
He tells his mother that, on the spiritual
plane, “Rank doesn’t count as a virtue.
High rank comes by being virtuous.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span></p>
<p>Also that “It isn’t always the parsons
that go highest first,” and that “It
isn’t what you’ve professed; it’s what
you’ve done.” Something of this kind
we have long suspected. Something of
this kind has long been hinted from the
plain pulpits of the world.</p>

<p>I fear it is the impatience of the human
mind, the hardness of the human
heart, which make us restless under too
much preaching. Volume after volume
of “messages” have been sent to us by
spirits during the last few years. There
is no fault to be found with any of them,
and that sad word, “uplifting,” may
well apply to all. Is it possible that, when
we die, we shall preach to one another;
or is it the elusiveness of ghostly audiences
which drives determined preachers
to the ouija board? The somewhat
presumptuous title, “To Walk With
God,” which Mrs. Lane and Mrs. Beale
have given to their volume of revelations,
was, we are told, commanded by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
the spirit who dictated it. “Stephen,”
the dead soldier who stands responsible
for the diffuse philosophy of “Our Unseen
Guest,” dedicates the book to the
“wistful” questioners who seek enlightenment
at his hands. “Anne Simon,” a
transcendental spirit with a strong bias
for hyphenated words, sends her modest
“Message,” dictated through her husband,
to “world-mortals for their regeneration.”</p>

<p>How lightly that tremendous word,
“regeneration,” is bandied about by our
ghostly preceptors. Mr. Basil King, in
“The Abolishing of Death,” reports the
spirit of Henry Talbot, the distinguished
Boston chemist, as saying, “My especial
mission is to regenerate the world.” It is
a large order. The ungrateful but always
curious mortal who would like a few
practical hints about chemistry, is told
instead that “grief is unrhythmical,”
which proves that Mr. Talbot never
read “In Memoriam”; or finds himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
beset by figurative phrases. “Literature
is the sun, music is the water, sculpture
is the earth, dancing is life, and painting
is the soul. These in their purity can
never be evil. I have spread a table in
your sight. Whatever is on it is for your
use. Take freely, and give it to others.
They hunger for the food.”</p>

<p>For what do we hunger? For any
word which will help us on our hard but
interesting way, any word which is wise,
or practically useful, or beautiful. It has
been revealed to Mr. King that poets as
splendid as Homer and Shakespeare
bloom in the spirit world. Why, in the
general assault by dead authors, are
<i>they</i> the silent ones? Could they not give
us one good play, one good lyric, one
good sonnet, just to show a glint of their
splendour? What is wrong with psychic
currents that they bear nothing of value?
“Stephen,” the “Unseen Guest,” assures
us that many a man we call a
genius “simply puts into words the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
thoughts of some greater mentality in
the other life.” But this is not adding to
our store. It is trying to take away from
us the merit of what we have. “Anne
Simon” reads the riddle thus: “In earth-proximity
the spirit leaves behind him
his efficacy, for the time, of Heaven-emanation;
so it is better to open the
heart, and wish the larger beneficence
than to visualize the spirit-form. For the
spirit-form without its spirit-treasure
does not bring the mortal to the higher
places.”</p>

<p>Which, though not wholly intelligible,
is doubtless true.</p>

<p>If we do not get what we hunger for,
what is it we receive? Professor Hyslop
once assured me that the authorship of
“Jap Herron” was “proved beyond
question.” This contented him, but dismayed
me. The eclipse of the “merry
star” which danced above Mark Twain’s
cradle, and which shone on him fitfully
through life, suggests direful possibilities<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
in the future. It is whispered that
O. Henry is busily dictating allegories
and tracts; that Dickens may yet reveal
“The Mystery of Edwin Drood”; that
Washington Irving has loomed on the
horizon of an aspiring medium. The
publication of “Shakespeare’s Revelations,
by Shakespeare’s Spirit: A Soul’s
Record of Defeat,” adds a touch of fantastic
horror to the situation. The taste
of the world, like the sanity of the world,
has seemingly crashed into impotence.</p>

<p>Patience Worth is fortunate in so far
that she has no earlier reputation at
stake. In fact, we are informed that
three of her stories are told in “a dialect
which, taken as a whole, was probably
never spoken, and certainly never
written. Each seems to be a composite
of dialect words and idioms of different
periods and different localities.” It is
Mr. Yost’s opinion, however, that her
long historical novel, “The Sorry Tale,”
is composed “in a literary tongue somewhat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
resembling the language of the
King James version of the Bible in form
and style, but with the unmistakable
verbal peculiarities of Patience Worth.”
“What bringeth thee asearch?” and
“Who hath the trod of the antelope?”
are doubtless verbal peculiarities; but
for any resemblance to the noble and
vigorous lucidity of the English Bible
we may search in vain through the six
hundred and forty closely printed pages
of this confused, wandering, sensuous,
and wholly unreadable narrative, which
purports to tell the life-history of the
penitent thief. I quote a single paragraph,
snatched at random from the
text, which may serve as a sample of
the whole:</p>

<p>“And within, upon the skins’-pack,
sat Samuel, who listed him, and lo, the
jaws of him hung ope. And Jacob wailed,
and the Jew’s tongue of him sounded as
the chatter of fowls, and he spake of
the fool that plucked of his ass that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
save of down. Yea, and walked him at
the sea’s edge, and yet sought o’ pools.
And he held aloft unto the men who
hung them o’er the bin’s place handsful
of brass and shammed precious stuffs,
and cried him out.”</p>

<p>Six hundred and forty pages of this
kind of writing defy a patient world.
And we are threatened with “the larger
literature to come”!</p>

<p>“Hope Trueblood,” Patience Worth’s
last novel, is written in intelligible English,
as is also the greater part of her
verse. The story deals with the doubtful
legitimacy of a little girl in an English
village which has lived its life along such
straight lines that the mere existence of
a bastard child, or a child thought to be
a bastard, rocks it to its foundations,
and furnishes sufficient matter for violent
and heart-wounding scenes from
the first chapter to the last. It is difficult
to follow the fortunes of this child
(who might have been the great original<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
devil baby of Hull House for the pother
she creates) because of the confusion of
the narrative, and because of the cruelly
high pitch at which all emotions are
sustained; but we gather that the marriage
lines are at last triumphantly produced,
and that the village is suffered
to relapse into the virtuous somnolence
of earlier days.</p>

<p>Mr. Yost, who has edited all of Patience
Worth’s books, and who is perhaps
a partial critic, praises her poems
for their rare individuality. We may
search in vain, he says, through literature
for anything resembling them.
“They are alike in the essential features
of all poetry, and yet they are unalike.
There is something in them that is not
in other poetry. In the profusion of their
metaphor there is an etherealness that
more closely resembles Shelley, perhaps,
than any other poet; but the beauty of
Shelley’s poems is almost wholly in their
diction; there is in him no profundity of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
thought. In these poems there is both
beauty and depth,—and something
else.”</p>

<p>Whatever this “something else” may
be, it is certainly not rhyme or rhythm.
The verses brook no bondage, but run
loosely on with the perilous ease of enfranchisement.
For the most part they
are of the kind which used to be classified
by compilers as “Poems of Nature,”
and “Poems of Sentiment and Reflection.”
Spring, summer, autumn, and
winter are as inspirational for the dead
as for the living.</p>

<p>We are told that once, when Patience
Worth was spelling out the endless pages
of “The Sorry Tale,” she came to a sudden
stop, then wrote, “This be nuff,”
and knocked off for the night. A blessed
phrase, and, of a certainty, her finest inspiration.
Would that all dead authors
would adopt it as their motto; and with
ouija boards, and table-legs, and automatic
pencils, write as their farewell
message to the world those three short,
comely words, “This be nuff.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Consolations_of_the">Consolations of the
Conservative</h2>
</div>


<p>There is a story of Hawthorne’s
which is little known, because it is
too expansively dull to be read. It tells
how the nations of the earth, convulsed
by a mighty spasm of reform, rid themselves
of the tools and symbols of all
they held in abhorrence. Because they
would have no more war, they destroyed
the weapons of the world. Because they
would have no more drunkenness, they
destroyed its wines and spirits. Because
they banned self-indulgence, they destroyed
tobacco, tea, and coffee. Because
they would have all men to be
equal, they destroyed the insignia of
rank, from the crown jewels of England
to the medal of the Cincinnati. Wealth
itself was not permitted to survive, lest
the new order be as corrupt as was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
old. Nothing was left but the human
heart with its imperishable and inalienable
qualities; and while it beats within
the human breast, the world must still
be moulded by its passions. “When
Cain wished to slay his brother,” murmured
a cynic, watching the great guns
trundled to the blaze, “he was at no loss
for a weapon.”</p>

<p>If belief in the perfectibility of man—and
not of man only, but of governments—is
the inspiration of liberalism,
of radicalism, of the spirit that calls
clamorously for change, and that has
requisitioned the words reform and progression,
sympathy with man and with
his work, with the beautiful and imperfect
things he has made of the chequered
centuries, is the keynote of conservatism.
The temperamental conservative
is a type vulnerable to ridicule, yet not
more innately ridiculous than his neighbours.
He has been carelessly defined as
a man who is cautious because he has a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
good income, and content because he is
well placed; who is thick-headed because
he lacks vision, and close-hearted because
he is deaf to the moaning wind
which is the cry of unhappy humanity
asking justice from a world which has
never known how to be just. Lecky,
who had a neat hand at analysis, characterized
the great conflicting parties
in an axiom which pleased neither:
“Stupidity in all its forms is Tory; folly
in all its forms is Whig.”</p>

<p>These things have been too often said
to be quite worth the saying. Stupidity
is not the prerogative of any one class or
creed. It is Heaven’s free gift to men of
all kinds, and conditions, and civilizations.
A practical man, said Disraeli, is
one who perpetuates the blunders of his
predecessor instead of striking out into
blunders of his own. Temperamental
conservatism is the dower (not to be
coveted) of men in whom delight and
doubt—I had almost said delight and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
despair—contend for mastery; whose
enjoyment of colour, light, atmosphere,
tradition, language and literature is
balanced by chilling apprehensiveness;
whose easily won pardon for the shameless
revelations of an historic past brings
with it no healing belief in the triumphant
virtues of the future.</p>

<p>The conservative is not an idealist,
any more than he is an optimist. Idealism
has worn thin in these days of
colossal violence and colossal cupidity.
Perhaps it has always been a cloak for
more crimes than even liberty sheltered
under her holy name. The French
Jacobins were pure idealists; but they
translated the splendour of their aspirations,
the nobility and amplitude of
their great conception, into terms of
commonplace official murder, which are
all the more displeasing to look back
upon because of the riot of sentimentalism
and impiety which disfigured them.
It is bad enough to be bad, but to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
bad in bad taste is unpardonable. If we
had resolutely severed the word “idealism”
from the bloody chaos which is
Russia, we should have understood more
clearly, and have judged no less leniently,
the seething ambitions of men
who passionately desired, and desire,
control. The elemental instinct of self-preservation
is the first step to the
equally elemental instinct of self-interest.
Natural rights, about which we
chatter freely, are not more equably
preserved by denying them to one class
of men than by denying them to another.
They have been ill-protected
under militarism and capitalism; and
their subversion has been a sin crying
out to Heaven for vengeance. They are
not protected at all under any Soviet
government so far known to report.</p>

<p>Nothing is easier than to make the
world safe for democracy. Democracy
is playing her own hand in the game.
She has every intention and every opportunity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
to make the world safe for
herself. But democracy may be divorced
from freedom, and freedom is
the breath of man’s nostrils, the strength
of his sinews, the sanction of his soul.
It is as painful to be tyrannized over by
a proletariat as by a tsar or by a corporation,
and it is in a measure more
disconcerting, because of the greater
incohesion of the process. It is as revolting
to be robbed by a reformer as by a
trust. Oppressive taxation, which forced
the great Revolution upon France; dishonest
“deals,” which have made a
mockery of justice in the United States;
ironic laws, framed for the convenient
looting of the bourgeoisie in Russia;—there
is as much idealism in one device
as in the others. Sonorous phrases like
“reconstruction of the world’s psychology,”
and “creation of a new world-atmosphere,”
are mental sedatives, drug
words, calculated to put to sleep any
uneasy apprehensions. They may mean<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
anything, and they do mean nothing,
so that it is safe to go on repeating
them. But a Bolshevist official was arrested
in Petrograd in March, 1919,
charged with embezzling fifteen million
rubles. Not content with the excesses of
the new régime, he must needs revert to
the excesses of the old,—a discouraging
study in evolution.</p>

<p>When Lord Hugh Cecil published his
analysis of conservatism nine years ago,
the British reviewers devoted a great
deal of time to its consideration,—not
so much because they cared for what the
author had to say (though he said it
thoughtfully and well), as because they
had opinions of their own on the subject,
and desired to give them utterance.
Cecil’s conception of temperamental, as
apart from modern British political conservatism
(which he dates from Pitt and
Burke), affords the most interesting
part of the volume; but the line of
demarcation is a wavering one. That<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
famous sentence of Burke’s concerning
innovations that are not necessarily
reforms, “They shake the public security,
they menace private enjoyment,”
shows the alliance between temperament
and valuation. It was Burke’s
passionate delight in life’s expression,
rather than in life’s adventure, that
made him alive to its values. He was not
averse to change: change is the law of
the universe; but he changed in order to
preserve. The constructive forces of the
world persistently won his deference
and support.</p>

<p>The intensely British desire to have a
moral, and, if possible, a religious foundation
for a political creed would command
our deepest respect, were the human
mind capable of accommodating
its convictions to morality and religion,
instead of accommodating morality and
religion to its convictions. Cecil, a stern
individualist, weighted with a heavy
sense of personal responsibility, and disposed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
to distrust the kindly intervention
of the State, finds, naturally enough,
that Christianity is essentially individualistic.
“There is not a line of the New
Testament that can be quoted in favour
of the enlargement of the function of
the State beyond the elementary duty
of maintaining order and suppressing
crime.”</p>

<p>The obvious retort to this would be
that there is not a line in the New Testament
which can be quoted in favour of
the confinement of the function of the
State to the elementary duty of maintaining
order and suppressing crime.
The counsel of Christ is a counsel of
perfection, and a counsel of perfection
is necessarily personal and intimate.
What the world asks now are state
reforms and social reforms,—in other
words, the reformation of our neighbours.
What the Gospel asks, and has
always asked, is the reformation of ourselves,—a
harassing and importunate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
demand. Mr. Chesterton spoke but the
truth when he said that Christianity
has not been tried and found wanting.
It has been found difficult, and not
tried.</p>

<p>Cecil’s conclusions anent the unconcern
of the Gospels with forms of government
were, strangely enough, the
points very ardently disputed by Bible-reading
England. A critic in the “Contemporary
Review” made the interesting
statement that the political economy
of the New Testament is radical and
sound. He illustrated his argument with
the parable of the labourers in the vine-yard,
pointing out that the master paid
the men for the hours in which they had
had no work. “In the higher economics,”
he said, “the State, as representing
the community, is responsible for
those who, through the State’s malfeasance,
misfeasance, or nonfeasance,
are unable to obtain the work for which
they wait.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span></p>

<p>But apart from the fact that the parable
is meant to have a spiritual and not
a material significance, there is nothing
in the Gospel to indicate that the master
considered that he owed the late-comers
their day’s wage. His comment
upon his own action disclaims this assumption:
“Is it not lawful for me to do
what I will with mine own?” And it is
worthy of note that the protest against
his liberality comes, not from other
vine-growers objecting to a precedent,
but from the labourers who cannot be
brought to see that an hour’s work done
by their neighbours may be worth as
much as twelve hours’ work done by
themselves. Human nature has not altered
perceptibly in the course of two
thousand years.</p>

<p>Great Britain’s experiment in doling
out “unemployment pay” was based on
expediency, and on the generous hypothesis
that men and women, outside
of the professional pauper class, would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
prefer work with wages to wages without
work. A cartoon in “Punch” representing
the Minister of Labour blandly
and insinuatingly presenting a house-maid’s
uniform to an outraged “ex-munitionette,”
who is the Government’s
contented pensioner, suggests
some rift in this harmonious understanding.
Progressives have branded
temperamental conservatism as distrust
of the unknown,—a mental attitude
which is the antithesis of love of adventure.
But distrust of the unknown is a
thin and fleeting emotion compared with
distrust of human nature, which is perfectly
well known. To know it is not
necessarily to quarrel with it. It is
merely to take it into account.</p>

<p>Economics and ethics have little in
common. They meet in amity, only to
part in coldness. Our preference for our
own interests is essentially and vitally
un-Christian. The competitive system is
not a Christian system. But it lies at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
root of civilization; it has its noble as
well as its ignoble side; it is the main-spring
of both nationalism and internationalism;
it is the force which supports
governments, and the force which
violently disrupts them. Men have risen
above self-interest for life; nations, superbly
for a time. The sense of shock
which was induced by Germany’s acute
reversion to barbarism was deeper than
the sense of danger induced by her
vaulting ambitions. There is no such
passionate feeling in life as that which
is stirred by the right and duty of defence;
and for more than four years the
Allied nations defended the world from
evils which the world fancied it had long
outgrown. The duration of the war is
the most miraculous part of the miraculous
tale. A monotony of heroism, a
monotony of sacrifice, transcends imagination.</p>

<p>Now it is over. Citizens of the United
States walked knee-deep in newspapers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
for a joyous night to signify their satisfaction,
and at once embarked on vivacious
disputes over memorial arches,
and statues, and monuments. The nations
of Europe, with lighter pockets
and heavier stakes, began to consider
difficulties and to cultivate doubts. No
one can fail to understand the destructive
forces of the world, because they
have given object-lessons on a large and
lurid scale. But the constructive forces
are on trial, with imposing chances of
success or failure. They are still in the
wordy stage, and now, as never before,
the world is sick of words. “This is
neither the time nor the place for superfluous
phrases,” said Clemenceau
(ironically, one hopes), when he placed
in the hands of Count von Brockdorff-Rantzau
a peace treaty which some
stony-hearted wag has informed us was
precisely the length of “A Tale of Two
Cities.” The appalling discursiveness of
the Versailles Conference has added to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
the confusion of the world; but fitted
into the “Preamble” of the Covenant
of the League of Nations are five little
vocables, four of them monosyllabic,
which embody the one arresting
thought that dominates and authorizes
the articles,—“Not to resort to war.”
These five words are the crux of the
whole serious and sanguine scheme.
They hold the hope of the weak, and
the happiness of the insecure. They
deny to the strong the pleasures—and
the means—of coercion.</p>

<p>The rapid changes wrought by the
twentieth century are less disconcerting
to the temperamental conservative,
who is proverbially slow, than movements
which take time to be persuasive.
For one thing, the vast spiral along
which the world spins brings him face
to face with new friends before he loses
sight of the old. The revolutionary of
yesterday is the reactionary of to-day,
and the conservative finds himself hob-nobbing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
with men and women whom he
had thought remote as the Poles.</p>

<p>Two interesting examples are Madame
Catherine Breshkovskaya and
Mr. Samuel Gompers. Time was, and
not so many years ago, when both condoned
violence—the violence of the
Russian Nihilist, the violence of the
American dynamiter—as a short road
to justice. Their attitude was not unlike
that of the first Southern lynchers:
“We take the law into our own hands,
because conditions are unbearable, and
the State affords no adequate relief.”
But Madame Breshkovskaya has seen
the forces she helped to set in motion
sweeping in unanticipated and shattering
currents. She has seen a new terrorism
arise and wield the weapons of the
old to crush man’s sacred freedom. The
peasants she loved have been beyond
the reach of her help. The country for
which she suffered thirty years of exile
repudiated her. Radicals in Europe and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
in the United States mocked at her.
The Grandmother of the Revolution
has become a conservative old lady,
concerned, as good grandmothers ought
to be, with the welfare of little children,
and pleading pitifully for order and education.</p>

<p>As for Mr. Gompers, his unswerving
loyalty to the cause of the Allies, his unswerving
rejection of Germany and all
her works, will never be forgiven by
pacifists, by the men and women who
had no word of protest or of pity when
Belgium was invaded, when the Lusitania
was sunk, when towns were
burned, civilians butchered, and girls
deported; and who recovered their
speech only to plead for the nation that
had disregarded human sufferings and
human rights. Mr. Gompers helped as
much as any one man in the United
States to win the war, and winning a
war is very distasteful to those who do
not want to fight. Therefore has he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
been relegated by international Socialists,
who held hands for four years with
Pan-German Socialists, to the ranks
of the conservatives. When the “Nation,”
speaking <i>ex cathedra</i>, says, “The
authority of the old machine-type of
labour leader like Mr. Gompers is impaired
beyond help or hope,” we hear
the echo of the voices which babbled
about capitalism and profiteering in
April, 1917. The Great War has made
and unmade the friendships of the
world. If the radicals propose it as a
test, as a test the conservatives will
accept it.</p>

<p>The successive revolutions which
make the advance-guard of one movement
the rear-guard of the next are as
expeditious and as overwhelming in the
field of art as in the fields of politics and
sociology. In the spring of 1877 an exhibition
of two hundred and forty pictures,
the work of eighteen artists, was
opened in the rue le Peletier, Paris.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
For some reason, never sufficiently explained,
Parisians found in these canvases
a source of infinite diversion.
They went to the exhibition in a mood
of obvious hilarity. They began to
laugh while they were still in the
street, they laughed as they climbed the
stairs, they were convulsed with laughter
when they looked at the pictures,
they laughed every time they talked
them over with their friends.</p>

<p>Now what were these mirth-provoking
works of art? Not cubist diagrams, not
geometrical charts of human anatomy,
not reversible landscapes, not rainbow-tinted
pigs. Such exhilarants lay in wait
for another century and another generation.
The pictures which so abundantly
amused Paris in 1877 were painted by
Claude Monet, Pissarro, Cézanne, Renoir,—men
of genius, who, having
devised a new and brilliant technique,
abandoned themselves with too little
reserve to the veracities of impressionism.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
They were not doctrinaires. The
peace they disturbed was only the
peace of immobility. But they were
drunk with new wine. Their strength
lay in their courage and their candour;
their weakness in the not unnatural
assumption that they were expressing
the finalities of art.</p>

<p>Defenders they had in plenty. No
pioneer can escape from the hardship of
vindication. Years before, Baudelaire
had felt it incumbent upon himself, as
a professional mutineer, to support the
“fearless innovations” of Manet. Zola,
always on the lookout for somebody to
attack or to defend, was equally enthusiastic
and equally choleric. Loud
disputation rent the air while the world
sped on its way, and lesser artists discovered,
to their joy, what a facile
thing it was to produce nerve-racking
novelties. In 1892, John La Farge,
wandering disconsolately through the
exhibitions of Paris, wondered if there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
might not still be room for something
simple in art.</p>

<p>Ever and always the reproach cast
at the conservative is that he has been
blind in the beginning to the beauty
he has been eventually compelled to
recognize; and ever and always he replies
that, in the final issue, he is the
guardian of all beauty. His are the imperishable
standards, his is the love for
a majestic past, his is the patience to
wait until the wheat has been sorted
from the chaff, and gathered into the
granaries of the world. If he be hostile
to the problematic, which is his weakness,
he is passionately loyal to the
tried and proven, which is his strength.
He is as necessary to human sanity as
the progressive is necessary to human
hope.</p>

<p>Civilization and culture are very old
and very beautiful. They imply refinement
of humour, a disciplined taste, sensitiveness
to noble impressions, and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
wise acceptance of the laws of evidence.
These things are not less valuable for
being undervalued. “At the present
time,” says the most acute of American
critics, Mr. Brownell, “it is quite generally
imagined that we should gain
rather than lose by having Raphael
without the Church, and Rembrandt
without the Bible.” The same notion,
less clearly defined, is prevalent concerning
Milton and Dante. We had
grown weary of large and compelling
backgrounds until the Great War focussed
our emotions. We are impatient
still of large and compelling traditions.
The tendency is to localization and
analysis.</p>

<p>The new and facile experiments in
verse, which have some notable exponents,
are interesting and indecisive.
Midway between the enthusiasm of the
experimenters (which is not contagious)
and the ribald gibes of the disaffected
(which are not convincing) the conservative<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
critic practises that watchful
waiting, so safe in the world of art, so
hazardous in the world of action. He
cannot do as he has been bidden, and
judge the novel product by its own
standards, for that would be to exempt
it from judgment. Nothing—not even
a German—can be judged by his—or
its—own standard. If there is to be
any standard at all, it must be based on
comparison. Keen thoughts and vivid
words have their value, no matter in
what form they are presented; but unless
that form be poetical, the presentation
is not poetry. There is a world of
truth in Mr. Masters’s brief and bitter
lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Beware of the man who rises to power</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From one suspender.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It has the kind of sagacity which is embodied
in the old adage, “You cannot
make a silk purse out of a sow’s ear,”
and it is as remote from the requirements
of prosody.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span></p>

<p>The medium employed by Walt
Whitman, at times rhythmic and cadenced,
at times ungirt and sagging
loosely, enabled him to write passages
of sustained beauty, passages grandly
conceived and felicitously rendered. It
also permitted him a riotous and somewhat
monotonous excess. Every word
misused revenges itself forever upon a
writer’s reputation. The medium employed
by the unshackled poets of to-day
is capable of vivid and accurate
imagery. It has aroused—or revealed—habits
of observation. It paints pen-pictures
cleverly. In the hands of
French, British, and American experts,
it shows sobriety, and a clear consciousness
of purpose. But it is useless to
deny that the inexpert find it perilously
easy. The barriers which protect an ordinary
four-lined stanza are not hard
to scale; but they do exist, and they
sometimes bring the versifier to a halt.
Without them, nothing brings him to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
a halt, save the limits of the space
allotted by grudging newspapers and
periodicals.</p>

<p>Yet brevity is the soul of song, no
less than the soul of wit. Those lovely
lyrics, swift as the note of a bird on the
wing, imperishable as a jewel, haunting
as unforgotten melody, are the fruits
of artifice no less than of inspiration. In
eight short lines, Landor gave “Rose
Aylmer” to an entranced and forever
listening world. There is magic in the
art that made those eight lines final.
A writer of what has been cynically
called “socialized poetry” would have
spent the night of “memories and sighs”
in probing and specifying his emotions.</p>

<p>The conservative’s inheritance from
the radical’s lightly rejected yesterdays
gives him ground to stand on, and
a simplified point of view. In that very
engaging volume, “The Education of
Henry Adams,” the autobiographer tells
us in one breath how much he desires<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
change, and, in the next, how much he
resents it. He would like to upset an already
upset world, but he would also
like to keep the Pope in the Vatican,
and the Queen in Windsor Castle. He
feels that by right he should have been
a Marxist, but the last thing he wants
to see is a transformed Europe. The bewildered
reader might be pardoned for
losing himself in this labyrinth of uncertainties,
were it not for an enlightening
paragraph in which the author expresses
unqualified amazement at Motley’s keen
enjoyment of London society.</p>

<p>“The men of whom Motley must have
been thinking were such as he might
meet at Lord Houghton’s breakfasts:
Grote, Jowett, Milman, or Froude;
Browning, Matthew Arnold, or Swinburne;
Bishop Wilberforce, Venables,
or Hayward; or perhaps Gladstone,
Robert Lowe, or Lord Granville....
Within the narrow limits of this class
the American Legation was fairly at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
home; possibly a score of houses, all liberal
and all literary, but perfect only in
the eyes of a Harvard College historian.
They could teach little worth knowing,
for their tastes were antiquated, and
their knowledge was ignorance to the
next generation. What was altogether
fatal for future purpose, they were only
English.”</p>

<p>Apart from the delightful conception
of the author of “Culture and Anarchy,”
and the author of “Atalanta in Calydon,”
as “only English,” the pleasure the
conservative reader takes in this peremptory
estimate is the pleasure of possession.
To him belongs the ignorance of
Jowett and Grote, to him the obsoleteness
of Browning. From every one of
these discarded luminaries some light
falls on his path. In fact, a flash of
blinding light was vouchsafed to Mr.
Adams, when he and Swinburne were
guests in the house of Monckton Milnes.
Swinburne was passionately praising<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
the god of his idolatry, Victor Hugo;
and the young American, who knew
little and cared less about French poetry,
ventured in a half-hearted fashion to
assert the counter-claims of Alfred de
Musset. Swinburne listened impatiently,
and brushed aside the comparison with
a trenchant word: “De Musset did not
sustain himself on the wing.”</p>

<p>If a bit of flawless criticism from an
expert’s lips be not educational, then
there is nothing to be taught or learned
in the world. Of the making of books
there is no end; but now as ever the
talker strikes the light, now as ever
conversation is the appointed medium
of intelligence and taste.</p>

<p>It is well that the past yields some
solace to the temperamental conservative,
for the present is his only on terms
he cannot easily fulfil. His reasonable
doubts and his unreasonable prejudices
block the path of contentment. He is
powerless to believe a thing because it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
an eminently desirable thing to believe.
He is powerless to deny the existence of
facts he does not like. He is powerless to
credit new systems with finality. The
sanguine assurance that men and nations
can be legislated into goodness,
that pressure from without is equivalent
to a moral change within, needs a
strong backing of inexperience. “The
will,” says Francis Thompson, “is the
lynch-pin of the faculties.” We stand or
fall by its strength or its infirmity. Where
there is no temptation, there is no virtue.
Parental legislation for the benefit
of the weak leaves them as weak as
ever, and denies to the strong the birthright
of independence, the hard, resistant
manliness with which they work
out their salvation. They may go to
heaven in leading-strings, but they cannot
conquer Apollyon on the way.</p>

<p>The well-meant despotism of the reformer
accomplishes some glittering results,
but it arrests the slow progress of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
civilization, which cannot afford to be
despotic. Mr. Bagehot, whose cynicism
held the wisdom of restraint, maintained
that the “cake of custom” should
be stiff enough to make change of any
kind difficult, but never so stiff as
to make it impossible. The progress
achieved under these conditions would
be, he thought, both durable and endurable.
“Without a long-accumulated
and inherited tendency to discourage
originality, society would never have
gained the cohesion requisite for effecting
common action against its external
foes.” Deference to usage is a
uniting and sustaining bond. Nations
which reject it are apt to get off the
track, and have to get back, or be put
back, with difficulty and disaster. They
do not afford desirable dwelling-places
for thoughtful human beings, but they
give notable lessons to humanity. Innovations
to which we are not committed
are illuminating things.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span></p>

<p>If the principles of conservatism are
based on firm supports, on a recognition
of values, a sense of measure and
proportion, a due regard for order,—its
prejudices are indefensible. The
wise conservative does not attempt to
defend them; he only clings to them
more lovingly under attack. He recognizes
triumphant science in the telephone
and the talking machine, and his
wish to escape these benefactions is but
a humble confession of unworthiness.
He would be glad if scientists, hitherto
occupied with preserving and disseminating
sound, would turn their attention
to suppressing it, would collect noise as
an ashman collects rubbish, and dump
it in some lonely place, thus preserving
the sanity of the world. He agrees with
Mr. Edward Martin (who bears the
hall-mark of the caste) that periodicals
run primarily for advertisers, and secondarily
for readers, are worthy of regard,
and that only the tyranny of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
habit makes him revolt from so nice an
adjustment of interests. Why, after all,
should he balk at pursuing a story, or
an article on “Ballads and Folk-Songs
of the Letts,” between columns of well-illustrated
advertisements? Why should
he refuse to leap from chasm to chasm,
from the intimacies of underwear to
electrical substitutes for all the arts of
living? There is no hardship involved
in the chase, and the trail is carefully
blazed. Yet the chances are that he
abandons the Letts, reminding himself
morosely that three years ago he was
but dimly aware of their existence; and
their “rich vein of traditional imagery,”
to say nothing of their early edition of
Luther’s catechism, fades from his intellectual
horizon.</p>

<p>If we are too stiff to adjust ourselves
to changed conditions, we are bound to
play a losing game. Yet the moral element
in taste survives all change, and
denies to us a ready acquiescence in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
innovations whose only merit is their
practicality. Through the reeling years
of war, the standard set by taste remained
a test of civilization. In these
formidable years of peace, racked by
anxieties and shadowed by disillusions
(Franklin’s ironic witticism concerning
the blessedness of peace-makers was
never more applicable than to-day),
the austerity of taste preserves our
self-respect. We are under no individual
obligation to add to the wealth of nations.
It is sometimes a pleasant duty
to resist the pervasive pressure of the
business world.</p>

<p>Political conservatism may be a lost
cause in modern democracy; but temperamental
conservatism dates from
the birth of man’s reasoning powers,
and will survive the clamour and chaos
of revolutions. It may rechristen its
political platform, but the animating
spirit will be unchanged. As a matter of
fact, great conservatives have always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
been found in the liberal ranks, and
Tory Cassandras, who called themselves
radicals, have prophesied with
dismal exactitude. It was a clear-eyed,
clear-voiced Socialist who, eight years
before the war, warned British Socialists
that they would do well to sound
the temper of German Socialists before
agitating for a reduction of the British
navy. M. Paul Deschanel says of the
French that they have revolutionary
imaginations and conservative temperaments.
An English critic has used nearly
the same terms in defining the elemental
principles of civilization,—conservatism
of technique and spiritual restlessness.
It is the fate of man to do his
own thinking, and thinking is subversive
of content; but a sane regard for
equilibrium is his inheritance from the
travail of centuries. He sees far who
looks both ways. He journeys far who
treads a known track.</p>

<p>Resistance, which is the function of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
conservatism, is essential to orderly advance.
It is a force in the social and
political, as well as in the natural order.
A party of progress, a party of stability,—call
them by what names we please,—they
will play their rôles to the end.
The hopefulness of the reformer (Savonarola’s
bonfire of vanities is an historic
precedent for Hawthorne’s allegory) is
balanced by the patience of the conservative,
which has survived the disappointments
of time, and is not yet
exhausted. He at least knows that “the
chief parts of human doom and duty
are eternal,” and that the things which
can change are not the things essential
to the support of his soul. We stand at
the door of a new day, and are sanguine
or affrighted according to our temperaments;
but this day shall be transient
as the days which have preceded it, and,
like its predecessors, shall plead for
understanding and pardon before the
bar of history.</p>

<h2>The Cheerful Clan</h2></div>

<p>Now that the Great War is a thing
of the past, there is no longer any
need to be cheerful. For years a valorous
gaiety has been the rôle assigned
us. For years we struck a hopeful note,
whether it rang true or false. For years
the plight of the world was so desperate
that we dared not look straight ahead,
lest the spectre of a triumphant Germany
smite us blind. Confronted with
a ruthlessness which threatened to extinguish
the liberties and decencies of
civilization, we simply had to cast about
us for a wan smile to hide from apprehensive
eyes the trouble of our souls.</p>

<p>Now the beast of militarism has been
chained, and until it is strong enough
to break its fetters (which should be a
matter of years), we can breathe freely,
and try and heal our hurt. True, there is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
trouble enough on every side to stock a
dozen worlds. The beauty of France has
been unspeakably defiled. The butcheries
in Belgium scarred the nation’s soul.
The flower of British youth have perished.
Italy’s gaping wounds have festered
under a grievous sense of wrong.
Russia seethes with hatred and strife.
In the United States we see on one hand
a mad welter of lawlessness, idleness,
and greed; and, on the other, official
extravagance, administrative weakness,
a heavy, ill-adjusted burden of taxation,
and shameless profiteering. Our equilibrium
is lost, and with it our sense of
proportion. We are Lilliput and Brobdingnag
jumbled up together, which is
worse than anything Gulliver ever encountered.</p>

<p>But this displacement of balance, this
unruly selfishness, is but the inevitable
result of the world’s great upheaval. It
represents the human rebound from
high emotions and heavy sacrifices. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
emotions and the sacrifices have met
their reward. Germany cannot—for
some time to come—spring at our
throat. If we fail to readjust our industries
on a paying basis, we shall of course
go under, and lose the leadership of the
world. But we won’t be kicked under by
the Prussian boot.</p>

<p>Therefore cheerfulness is no longer
obligatory. We can shut the door in the
faces of its professional purveyors—who
have been making a good thing of
it—and look with restful seriousness
upon the mutability of life. Our intelligence,
so long insulted by the sentimental
inconsistencies which are the
text of the Gospel of Gladness, can
assert its right of rejection. The Sunshine
School of writers has done its
worst, and the fixed smile with which it
regards the universe is as offensive as
the fixed smile of chorus girls and college
presidents, of débutantes and high
officials, who are photographed for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
Sunday press, and who all look like
advertisements of dentifrice.</p>

<p>Popular optimism—the kind which
is hawked about like shoe-strings—is
the apotheosis of superficiality. The obvious
is its support, the inane is its
ornament. Consider the mental attitude
of a writer who does not hesitate to say
in a perfectly good periodical, which
does not hesitate to publish his words:
“Nothing makes a man happier than to
know that he is of use to his own time.”
Only in a sunburst of cheerfulness could
such a naked truism be shamelessly exposed.
I can remember that, when I was
a child, statements of this order were
engraved in neat script on the top line
of our copy-books. But it was understood
that their value lay in their chirography,
in the unapproachable perfection
of every letter, not in the message
they conveyed. Our infant minds
were never outraged by seeing them in
printed text. Those were serious and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
self-respecting days when no one sent
our mothers a calendar with three hundred
and sixty-five words of cheer, designed
to jack up the lowered morale of
the family. The missionary spirit was
at work then as now; but it mostly
dropped tracts on our doorstep, reminding
us that we might be in hell before
to-morrow morning.</p>

<p>The gaiety of life is a saving grace,
and high spirits are more than the appanage
of youth. They represent the
rebound of the resilient soul from moods
of dejection, and it is their transient
character which makes them so infectious.
Landor’s line,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“That word, that sad word, Joy,”</p>
</div>

<p class="p0">is manifestly unfair. Joy is a delightful,
flashing little word, as brief as is the
emotion it conveys. We all know what
it means, but nobody dares to preach
it, as they preach three-syllabled cheerfulness,
and gladness which once had a
heroic sound, the “gladness that hath<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
favour with God,” but which is now
perilously close to slang. The early
Christians, who had on a large scale the
courage of their convictions, found in
their faith sufficient warrant for content.
They seem to have lived and died with
a serenity, a perfect good humour, which
is the highest result of the best education.
But when Mr. Shaw attempted to
elucidate in “Androcles and the Lion”
this difficult and delicate conception, he
peopled his stage with Pollyannas, who
voiced their cheerfulness so clamorously
that they made persecution pardonable.
No public could be expected to endure
such talk when it had an easy method
of getting rid of the talkers.</p>

<p>The leniency of the law now leaves us
without escape. We cannot throw our
smiling neighbours to the lions, and they
override us in what seems to me a spirit
of cowardly exultation. Female optimists
write insufferable papers on “Happy
Hours for Old Ladies,” and male optimists<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
write delusive papers on “Happiness
as a Business Asset.” Reforming
optimists who, ten years ago, bade us
rejoice over the elimination of war,—“save
on the outskirts of civilization,”
now bid us rejoice over the elimination
of alcohol,—save on the tables of
the rich. Old-fashioned optimists, like
Mr. Horace Fletcher, put faith in the
“benevolent intentions” of nature,—nature
busy with the scorpion’s tail.
New-fashioned optimists, like Professor
Ralph Barton Perry (who may not
know how optimistic he is), put faith in
the mistrust of nature which has armed
the hands of men. Sentimental optimists,
the most pervasive of the tribe,
blur the fine outlines of life, to see which
clearly and bravely is the imperative
business of man’s soul.</p>

<p>For the world of thought is not one
whit more tranquil than the world of
action. The man whose “mind to him a
kingdom is” wears his crown with as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
much uneasiness as does a reigning
monarch. Giordano Bruno, who had
troubles of his own, and who knew
by what road they came, commended
ignorance as a safeguard from melancholy.
If, disregarding this avenue of
escape, we look with understanding,
and sometimes even with exhilaration,
upon the portentous spectacle of life,
if we have tempers so flawless that we
can hold bad hands and still enjoy the
game, then, with the sportsman’s relish,
will come the sportsman’s reward; a
reward, be it remembered, which is in
the effort only, and has little to do with
results.</p>

<p>The generous illusions which noble
souls like Emerson’s have cherished undismayed
are ill-fitted for loose handling.

In the spring of 1916, when
the dark days of the war were upon us,
and the toll of merchant ships grew
heavier week by week with Germany’s
mounting contempt for admonitions, I
heard a beaming gentleman point out to
a large audience, which tried to beam
responsively, that the “wonderful”
thing about the contest was the unselfish
energy it had awakened in the breasts
of American women. He dwelt unctuously
upon their relief committees, upon
the excellence of their hospital supplies,
upon their noble response to the needs
of humanity. He repeated a great many
times how good it was for <i>us</i> to do these
things. He implied, though he did not
say it in rude words, that the agony of
Europe was nicely balanced by the
social regeneration of America. He was
a sentimental Rochefoucauld, rejoicing,
without a particle of guile, that the misfortunes
of our friends had given us
occasion to manifest our friendship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span></p>

<p>It has been often asserted that unscrupulous
optimism is an endearing
trait, that the world loves it even when
forced to discountenance it, and that
“radiant” people are personally and
perennially attractive. Mr. Robert Louis
Stevenson said something of this sort,
and his authority is invoked by sentimentalists
who compile calendars, and
birthday books, and texts to encumber
our walls. They fail to distinguish the
finely tempered spirit which carried
Mr. Stevenson over the stony places of
life, and which was beautiful beyond
measure (the stones being many and
hard), from the inconsequent cheerfulness
which says that stones are soft.
We cannot separate an author from his
work, and nowhere in Stevenson’s books
does he guarantee anything more optimistic
than courage. The triumph of evil
in “Thrawn Janet,” the hopelessness
of escape from heredity in “Olalla,”
the shut door in “Markheim,” the stern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
contempt in “A Lodging for the Night,”
the inextinguishable and unpardonable
hatreds in “The Master of Ballantrae,”
even the glorious contentiousness of
“Virginibus Puerisque,”—where in
these masterful pages are we invited to
smile at life? We go spinning through it,
he admits, “like a party for the Derby.”
Yet “the whole way is one wilderness of
snares, and the end of it, for those who
fear the last pinch, is irrevocable ruin.”</p>

<p>This is a call for courage, for the courage
that lay as deep as pain in the souls
of Stevenson, and Johnson, and Lamb.
The combination of a sad heart and a
gay temper, which is the most charming
and the most lovable thing the world
has got to show, gave to these men their
hold upon the friends who knew them in
life, and still wins for them the personal
regard of readers. Lamb, the saddest
and the gayest of the three, cultivated
sedulously the little arts of happiness.
He opened all the avenues of approach.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
He valued at their worth a good play, a
good book, a good talk, and a good dinner.
He lived in days when occasional
drunkenness failed to stagger humanity,
and when roast pig was within the
income of an East India clerk. He had a
gift, subtle rather than robust, for enjoyment,
and a sincere accessibility to
pain. His words were unsparing, his actions
kind. He binds us to him by his
petulance as well as by his patience, by
his entirely human revolt from dull
people and tiresome happenings. He
was not one of those who</p>

    <div class="verse indent2">Their all, yet feel no aching void.</div>

    <div class="verse indent6">To be annoyed.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>On the contrary, the whimsical expression
of his repeated annoyance is balm
to our fretted souls.</p>

<p>For the friend whom we love is the
friend who gets wet when he is rained
on, who is candid enough to admit failure,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
and courageous enough to mock at
it. When Jane Austen wrote to her sister
that she did not have a very good time
at a party, because men were disposed
not to ask her to dance until they could
not help it, she did more than make
Cassandra smile; she won her way into
the hearts of readers for whom that letter
was not meant. We know the “radiant”
people to whom all occasions are
enjoyable, who intimate—with some
skill, I confess—that they carry mirth
and gaiety in their wake. They are
capable of describing a Thanksgiving
family dinner as mirthful because they
were participants. Not content with a
general profession of pleasure in living,
“which is all,” says Mr. Henry
Adams, “that the highest rules of good
breeding should ask,” they insist upon
the delightfulness of a downcast world,
and they offer their personal sentiments
as proof.</p>

<p>Dr. Johnson’s sputtering rage at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
happy old lady is the most human thing
recorded of his large and many-sided
humanity. A great thinker who confronted
life with courage and understanding
was set at naught, and, to
speak truth, routed, by an unthinking,
but extremely solid, asseveration. And
after all the old lady was not calling for
recruits; she was simply stating a case.
Miss Helen Keller, in a book called
“Optimism,” says very plainly that if
she, a blind deaf mute, can be happy,
every one can achieve happiness, and
that it is every one’s duty to achieve it.
Now there is not a decent man or woman
in the country who will not be glad to
know that Miss Keller is, as she says
she is, happy; but this circumstance
does not affect the conditions of life as
measured by all who meet them. The
whole strength of the preaching world
has gone into optimism, with the result
that it has reached a high place in man’s
estimation, is always spoken of with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
respect, and not infrequently mistaken
for a virtue.</p>

<p>Are we then so sunk in dejection, so
remote from the splendid and unconscious
joy which the struggle for life
gave to the centuries that are over?
Time was when men needed the curb,
and not the spur, in that valorous contention.
“How high the sea of human
delight rose in the Middle Ages,” says
Mr. Chesterton, “we know only by the
colossal walls they built to keep it
within bounds.” Optimism was as superfluous
as meliorism when the world was
in love with living, when Christianity
preached penance and atonement for
sin, striving by golden promises and
direful threats to wean man from that
unblessed passion, to turn the strong
tide of his nature back from the earth
that nourished it. There was never but
one thorough-going optimist among the
Fathers of the Church, and that was
Origen, who looked forward confidently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
to the final conversion of Satan. His
attitude was full of nobleness because
he had suffered grievously at the heathen’s
hands; but not even by the
alchemy of compassion is evil transmutable
to good.</p>

<p>The Stoics, who proposed that men
should practise virtue without compensation,
were logically unassailable,
but not persuasive to the average mind.
It does not take much perspicuity to
distinguish between an agreeable and a
disagreeable happening, and once the
difference is perceived, no argument can
make them equally acceptable. “Playing
at mummers is one thing,” says the
sapient tanner in Kenneth Grahame’s
“Headswoman,” “and being executed
is another. Folks ought to keep them
separate.” On the other hand, the assurance
of the Epicureans that goodness
and temperance were of value because
they conduced to content was liable to
be set aside by the man who found himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
contented without them. “The poor
world, to do it justice,” says Gilbert
Murray, “has never lent itself to any
such bare-faced deception as the optimism
of the Stoics”; but neither are we
disposed to recognize enlightened self-interest
as a spiritual agency. It may
perhaps be trusted to make a good husband
or a good vestryman, but not a
good human being.</p>

<p>A highly rational optimist, determined
to be logical at any cost, observed
recently in a British review that sympathy
was an invasion of liberty. “If
I must sorrow because another is sorrowing,
I am a slave to my feelings, and
it is best that I shall be slave to nothing.
Perfect freedom means that I am able
to follow my own will, and my will is
to be happy rather than to be sad. I love
pleasure rather than pain. Therefore if
I am moved to sorrow against my will,
I am enslaved by my sympathy.”</p>

<p>This is an impregnable position. It is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
the old, old philosophy of the cold heart
and the warm stomach. I do not say
that it is unwise. I say only that it is
unlikable.</p>

<p>For our quarrel with Christian Science
is, not that it prefers Mrs. Eddy to
Æsculapius, or her practitioners to his
practitioners; not that it sometimes
shames us by rising superbly above our
froward nerves, and on less happy occasions
denies the existence of a cold
which is intruding itself grossly upon
the senses; but that it exempts its followers
from legitimate pity and grief.
Only by refusing such exemption can
we play our whole parts in the world.
While there is a wrong done, we must
admit some measure of defeat; while
there is a pang suffered, we have no
right to unflawed serenity. To cheat
ourselves intellectually that we may
save ourselves spiritually is unworthy
of the creature that man is meant
to be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span></p>

<p>And to what end! Things are as they
are, and no amount of self-deception
makes them otherwise. The friend who
is incapable of depression depresses us
as surely as the friend who is incapable
of boredom bores us. Somewhere in our
hearts is a strong, though dimly understood,
desire to face realities, and to
measure consequences, to have done
with the fatigue of pretending. It is not
optimism to enjoy the view when one is
treed by a bull; it is philosophy. The
optimist would say that being treed was
a valuable experience. The disciple of
gladness would say it was a pleasurable
sensation. The Christian Scientist would
say there was no bull, though remaining—if
he were wise—on the tree-top.
The philosopher would make the
best of a bad job, and seek what compensation
he could find. He is of a class
apart.</p>

<p>If, as scientists assert, fear is the note
which runs through the universe, courage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
is the unconquerable beat of man’s
heart. A “wise sad valour” won the
war at a cost we do well to remember;
and from unnumbered graves comes a
stern reminder that the world can hold
wrongs which call for such a righting.
We for whom life has been made, not
safe, but worth the living, can now
afford “le bel sérieux” which befits the
time and occasion. When preachers
cease pointing out to us inaccessible
routes to happiness, we may stop the
chase long enough to let her softly overtake
us. When the Gospellers of Gladness
free us of their importunities, our
exhausted spirits may yet revive to
secret hours of mirth. When we frankly
abandon an attitude of cheerfulness, our
Malvolio smile may break into sudden
peals of laughter. What have we gained
from the past seven years if not zest for
the difficulties and dangers ahead of us?
What lesson have we learned but intrepidity?

<p>All the world does not love a lover.
It is a cultivated taste, alien to the
natural man, and unknown to childhood.
But all the world does love a sinner,
either because he is convertible to a
saint, or because a taste for law-breaking
is an inheritance from our first
parents, who broke the one and only
law imposed upon them. The little
children whom Fra Lippo Lippi sees
standing in a “row of admiration”
around the murderer on the altar step
express their innocent interest in crime.
Bayard, “sans peur et sans reproche,”
has never stirred the heart of youth as
has Robin Hood, that bold outlaw who
“beat and bound” unpopular sheriffs,
and “readjusted the distribution of
property,”—delightful phrase, as old
as the world, and as fresh as to-morrow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
morning. The terrible and undeserved
epithet, “blameless,” has robbed great
Arthur of his just meed of homage. The
“Master Thief” enjoyed, and still enjoys,
unmerited popularity.</p>

<p>I sometimes wonder what a man conscious
of talent, like the Master Thief,
would have thought if the simple criminologists
of his day—who knew no subtler
remedy than hanging—had confronted
him with clinics, and laboratories,
and pamphlets on the “disease
of crime.” I sometimes wonder how his
able descendants, like the humorous
rogues who stole the gold cup at Ascot;
or the wag who slipped the stolen
purses (emptied of their contents) into
the pocket of the Bishop of Lincoln;
or the redoubtable Raymond—alias
Wirth—who stole a shipping of Kimberley
diamonds and a Gainsborough
portrait, feel about their pathological
needs. “The criminal is a sick man, the
prison is his hospital, and the judge who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
sentenced him is his physician,” said
Dr. Vaughan, dean of the Medical School
in the University of Michigan. “Does a
hunting man give up riding to hounds
because he has had a fall?” asked a
stalwart “invalid,” serving a sentence
for burglary, of the chaplain who had
urged upon him the security of an honest
life.</p>

<p>It is always animating to hear the
convict’s point of view. In fact, everything
appertaining to criminology interests
us as deeply as everything
appertaining to pauperism bores and repels
us. Some years ago the “Nineteenth
Century” offered its pages as a debating-ground
for this absorbing theme.
Arguments were presented by Sir Alfred
Wills, a judge of twenty-one years’
standing, Sir Robert Anderson, author
of “Criminals and Crime,” and Mr.
H. J. B. Montgomery, an ex-convict and
a fluent writer, albeit somewhat supercilious
as befitted his estate. He took the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
bold and popular stand that society has
created the criminal class, that its members
detest the crimes they commit with
such apparent zest, and that they
should be “tended and cheered” instead
of subjected to the “extreme
stupidity” of prison life. Indeterminate
sentences which carry with them an element
of hope, and which should be an
incentive to reform because they imply
its possibility, he condemned without
reserve as putting a premium on hypocrisy.
But the point which of all others
aroused his just resentment was the demand
made by the two jurists for restitution.</p>

<p>This is the crux of a situation which
in the moral law is simplicity itself; but
which the evasiveness of the civil law
has unduly complicated, and which the
random humanitarianism of our day
has buried out of sight. Every crime is
an offence against the State. It is also in
ninety-nine cases out of a hundred an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
offence against a fellow-creature, which
fellow-creature is called a victim, and
interests nobody. Sir Alfred Wills and
Sir Robert Anderson both held that
thieves, big thieves especially, should
be compelled to say what disposition
had been made of stolen property, and
that they should be imprisoned for life
if they refused. Anderson was firm in
his insistence that the act of thieving
alienates such property actually, but not
legally or morally, from its owner, and
that serving a sentence for robbery does
not clear the robber’s title to the goods.
He also pointed out that the most heartless
thefts are committed daily at the
expense of people in decent but narrow
circumstances, because such people are
compelled to leave their homes unprotected.
He instanced the case of one
woman robbed of her scanty savings,
and of another who lost her dead soldier
husband’s medals, and the few poor
cherished trinkets he had given her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span></p>

<p>In the matter of restitution, Mr.
Montgomery stood fairly and squarely
for the felon’s rights. “The law,” he said,
“has nothing to do, and ought to have
nothing to do, with the disposal of the
booty”; and he was happy in the conviction
that it would never go so far as
to deprive the thief of the reward of his
labour, of the money stolen by the
sweat of his brow. As for staying in jail
until such restitution was made, that
was as ridiculous as the suggestion
sometimes offered that the convict’s
wages should be paid over to the man
he has robbed. Nobody cares about a
man who has been robbed. The interest
felt in the criminal extends itself occasionally
to the criminal’s family, but
never to the family he has wronged. In
the United States where robbery is the
order of the day, there isn’t sympathy
enough to go ’round among the many
who play a losing game. Chicago alone
boasts a record of one hundred and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
seventy-five hold-ups in two nights, an
amazing tribute to industry and zeal.
Many of the victims were stripped of
their coats as well as of their valuables,
there being plenty of time, and no need
on the thieves’ part for hurry or disorder.
The Chicago Crimes Commission
put the case with commendable brevity
when it said, “Crime is a business here.”</p>

<p>An interesting circumstance recorded
in Anderson’s volume is the reluctance
of professional burglars to ply their
craft on very cold and stormy nights.
It would seem as though bad weather
might be trusted to stand their friend;
but the burglar, a luxury-loving person,
dislikes being drenched or frozen as
much as does his honest neighbour.
Happily for his comfort and for his
health, a high-speed motor now enables
him to work on sunny days at noon. It
is pleasant to reflect that the experts
who robbed three Philadelphia jewellers
at an hour when the shops were full of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
customers, and the streets were full of
pedestrians, ran no risk from exposure.
They may have been sick men from the
psychologist’s point of view, but they
were as safe from bronchitis as they
were from the Philadelphia police.</p>

<p>It is an age of specialism, and the
criminal, like the scientist, has specialized.
Stealing Liberty Bonds is a field full
of promise for youth. Apparently nothing
can shake the confidence of brokers
in the messengers who disappear with
one lot of bonds, only to be released on a
suspended sentence, and speedily entrusted
with a second. The term “juvenile
delinquency” has been stretched
to cover every offence from murder
to missing school. A fourteen-year-old
girl who poisoned a fourteen-month-old
baby in Brooklyn, in the summer of 1919,
and who was tried in the Children’s Court,
was found guilty of juvenile delinquency,
and committed to a home for delinquent
girls. It is hard to say what else could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
have been done with a murderess of
such tender years; but the New York
authorities should see to it that Solomon
Kramer is the last baby whom Frances
Sulinski kills. She poisoned this one
with the single purpose of implicating
in the crime a woman of seventy with
whom she had quarrelled. The poor infant
lingered in pain twenty-four hours
before released by death. It is not easy
to throw a kindly light upon the deed;
and while a baby’s life is of small value
to the State (“as well be drowned as
grow up a tinker,” said Sir Walter
Scott), civilization means that it has a
right to protection. The law exists, not
for the punishment of the offender, and
not for his reformation, but that the
public may be safe from his hands.</p>

<p>A robust sense of humour might help
to straighten out the tangles which have
deranged the simple processes of jurisdiction.
When the court rendered a
decision freeing the prison authorities<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
of Tacoma from all responsibility in the
event of a hunger strike, a light dawned
on that stricken town. The I.W.W.,
who had refused to eat because they
objected to being detained in the county,
instead of in the city jail, were accorded
liberty to follow their desires. A threat
which for years had sufficed to throw
British and American prisons into consternation
was suddenly found to be
harmless to all but the threateners.
What really agitated the citizens of
Tacoma just then was, not so much
whether demagogues would consent to
eat the food provided for them, as
whether honest men could afford food
to eat.</p>

<p>A comic opera might be staged with
Ellis Island as a <i>mise en scène</i>. The
seventy-three “reds,” detained on that
asylum as undesirables, who sent an
“ultimatum,” modelled on the Berlin
pattern, to the Congressional Committee,
would have charmed Gilbert and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
inspired Sullivan. The solemnity with
which they notified the indifferent Congressmen
that at half-past eight o’clock,
Tuesday morning, November 25th,
1919, they would declare a hunger
strike, the consequences of which “shall
fall upon the head of the administration
of the island,” was surpassed by the
calmness with which they gave warning
that they would no longer attend the
hearings of the committee. Like the
heroine of Mr. Davidson’s ballad, who
told the Devil she would not stay in
hell, these gentlemen registered themselves
as outside the pale of coercion.
They seemed to think that by refusing
to eat, they could bend the law to their
will, and that by refusing to have their
cases heard, they could stop the slow
process of deportation.</p>

<p>It is painful to record this lack of
healthy humour on the part of political
offenders. Ordinary criminals are as a
rule neat hands at a joke, a practical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
joke especially, and convicts respond
alacritously to all intelligent efforts
to amuse them. Comedians, who from
time to time have offered their services
to relieve the sad monotony of prison
life, have found their audiences alert and
responsive. Not a joke is lost, not a song
or a skit but wins its way to favour. It is
this engaging receptiveness which has
made our captive thieves and cut-throats
so dear to the public heart.
They dilate with correct emotions when
they hear good music; and, in the dearth
of other diversions, they can produce
very creditable entertainments of their
own. The great Sing Sing pageant in
honour of Warden Osborne was full of
fun and fancy. It would have done
credit to the dramatic talent of any
college in the land. No wonder that we
detect a certain ostentation in the
claims made by honest men to familiarity
with rogues. The Honourable T. P.
O’Connor published a few years ago a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
series of papers with the arrogant title,
“Criminals I Have Known.” Could he
have attracted readers by boasting the
acquaintanceship of any other class of
fellow-creatures?</p>

<p>The sourness incidental to a grievance
deprives the political offender of this
winning vivacity. He is lamentably
high-flown in his language, and he has
no sense of the ridiculous. The Sinn
Feiners who wrecked the office of a
Dublin newspaper because it had alluded
to one of the men who tried to kill
Lord French as a “would-be assassin,”
should expend some of the money received
from the United States (in return
for stoning our sailors in Cork and
Queenstown) in the purchase of a dictionary.
“Assassin” is as good a word
as “murderer” any day of the week,
and a “would-be assassin” is no other
than a “would-be murderer.” The Sinn
Feiners explained in a letter to the editor
that the calumniated man was really<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
a “high-souled youth,” but this goes
without the saying. <i>All</i> political offenders
are high-souled youths. It is their
sub-title, eligible in oratory and obituary
notices, but not in the simple language
of the press.</p>

<p>Mr. W. C. Brownell alludes casually
to the social sentiment which instinctively
prefers the criminal to the police;
but he declines to analyze its rationale.
Perhaps, as I have already hinted, we
may inherit it from our father, Adam,
who could have felt no great kindness
for Saint Michael, the first upholder of
the given law. Justice is an unaccommodating,
unappealing virtue. Deep in
our hearts is a distaste for its rulings,
and a distrust of the fallible creatures
who administer it. Mr. Howells, writing
ten years ago in the “North American,”
condemned without reserve the authority
which, however assailable, is our
only bulwark against anarchy. “The
State,” he said, “is a collective despot,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
mostly inexorable, always irresponsible,
and entirely inaccessible to the personal
appeals which have sometimes moved
the obsolete tyrant to pity. In its selfishness
and meanness it is largely the legislated
and organized ideal of the lowest
and stupidest of its citizens, whose daily
life is nearest the level of barbarism.”</p>

<p>I am not without hope that the events
of the past ten years modified Mr.
Howells’s point of view. If the German
State revealed itself as something perilously
close to barbarism, the Allied
States presented a superb concentration
of their peoples’ unfaltering purpose.
That the world was saved from degradation
too deep to be measured was due
to individual heroism, animated, upheld,
and focused by the State. Though
temperamentally conservative, I feel no
shadow of regret for the “obsolete” and
very picturesque tyrant who softened
or hardened by caprice. I would rather
trust our stupid and venal authorities,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
because, while each member of a legislative
body is kind to his own deficiencies,
he is hard on his neighbour’s. Collective
criticism is a fair antidote for
collective despotism, and robs it of its
terrors.</p>

<p>If we were less incorrigibly sentimental,
we should be more nobly kind. Sentimentalism
is, and has always been,
virgin of standards. It is, and it has
always been, insensible to facts. The
moralists who, in the first years of the
war, protested against American munitions
because they were fresh-made for
purposes of destruction, would have
flung the victory into Germany’s hands
because her vast stores of munitions
had been prepared in times of peace.
When the news of the Belgian campaign
sickened the heart of humanity, more
than one voice was raised to say that
England had, by her treatment of militant
suffragists (a treatment so feeble,
so wavering, so irascible, and so soft-hearted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
that it would not have crushed
a rebellious snail), forfeited her right to
protest against the dishonouring of Belgian
women. The moral confusion which
follows mental confusion with a sure
and steady step is equally dangerous
and distasteful. It denies our integrity,
and it makes a mock of our understanding.</p>

<p>An irritated Englishman, who must
have come into close quarters with
British pacifists,—the least lovely of
their species,—has protested in “Blackwood’s
Magazine” that the one thing
dearer than the criminal to the heart of
the humanitarian is the enemy of his
country, whose offences he condones,
and whose punishment he sincerely
pities. Thus it happened that British
women joined American women in protesting
against the return of the cattle
stolen during the last months of the war
from northern France. They said—what
was undoubtedly true—that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
German children needed the milk.
French children also needed the milk
(witness the death-rates from tuberculosis
in and about Lille), but this concerned
them less. The herds belonged to
France, and their sympathy went out
to the raiders rather than to the raided.</p>

<p>In fact all pacifists seem disposed
to look benignly upon the “noble old
piracy game.” The Honourable Bertrand
Russell, whose annoyance at
England’s going to war deepened into
resentment at her winning it (a consummation
which, to speak truth, he did his
best to avert), expressed regret that the
sufferings of Belgium should have been
mistakenly attributed to Germany. Not
Berlin, he said, but war must be held
to blame; and if war were a natural
phenomenon, like an earth quake or
a thunderstorm, he would have been
right. The original Attila was not displeased
to be called the “Scourge of
God,” and pious Christians of the fifth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
century acquiesced in this shifting of
liability. They said, and they probably
believed, that Heaven had chosen a
barbarian to punish them for their sins.
To-day we are less at home in Zion, and
more insistent upon international law.
The sternest duty of civilization is the
assigning of responsibility for private
and for public crimes as the rules of
evidence direct.</p>

<p>In the Christmas issue of the “Atlantic
Monthly,” 1919, another Englishman
of letters, Mr. Clutton-Brock,
preached a sermon to Americans (we
get a deal of instruction from our neighbours),
the burden of which was the
paramount duty of forgiveness. Naturally
he illustrated his theme with an
appeal for Germany, because there is
so much to be forgiven her. That he
made no distinction between the injuries
which a citizen of Lille or Louvain,
and the injuries which a reader of the
“Atlantic Monthly” has to forgive, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
eminently right, forgiveness being due
for the greatest as well as for the least
of offences. The Frenchman or the
Belgian who forgives “from his heart”
reaches a higher standard than we do;
but the ethics of Christianity bind him
to that standard. It is his supreme spiritual
test.</p>

<p>What was less endearing in Mr.
Clutton-Brock’s sermon was the playful
manner in which he made light of
wrongs which, to say the least, were not
matters for sport. We were called on to
pardon, “not as an act of virtue, but in
good-humour, because we are all absurd,
and all need forgiveness.... We
all fail, and we have no right to say that
another man’s, or another nation’s,
failure is worse than our own.... We
must govern our behaviour to each
other by the axiom that no man is to be
judged by his past.”</p>

<p>These sentences aptly illustrate my
contention that the sentimentalist is as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
unconcerned with standards as with
facts. “Absurd” is not the word to
apply to Germany’s campaign in France
and Flanders. A man whose home has
been burned and whose wife has been
butchered cannot be expected to regard
the incident as an absurdity, or to recall
it with good-humour. The sight of a
child bayoneted on the roadside (five
wounds in one poor little body picked
up near Namur) arouses something deep
and terrible in the human heart. To say
that one man’s failure is no worse than
another man’s failure, that one nation’s
failure is no worse than another nation’s
failure, is to deny any vital distinction
between degrees of right and wrong.
It is to place the German Kaiser by the
side of Belgium’s King, and George
Washington by the side of George the
Third.</p>

<p>And by what shall men be judged, if
not by their past? What other evidence
can we seek? What other test can we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
apply? A man who has run away with
his neighbour’s wife may not care to
repeat the offence; he may be cured forever
of this particular form of covetousness;
but he is not welcomed in sedately
conducted households. A defaulter may
be converted to the belief that honesty
is the best policy; but few there are who
will entrust him with funds, and fewer
still who will receive him as a gentleman.
If such behaviour is, as Mr. Clutton-Brock
authoritatively asserts, opposed
to “a Christian technique,” it
defines the value of facts, and it holds
upright the standard of honour.</p>

<p>The well-meaning ladies and gentlemen
who flood society with appeals to
“open the prison door,” and let our
good-will shine as a star upon political
prisoners, seem curiously indifferent as
to what the liberated ones will do with
their liberty. There are few of us so base
as to desire to deprive our fellow-creatures
of sunlight and the open road.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
There are not many of us so unpractical
as to want to keep them a burden upon
the State, if we have any assurance that
they will not be a menace to the State
when released. Sufficiency, security, and
freedom have been defined as the prerogatives
of civilized man. The cry of
the revolutionist for freedom is met by
the call of sober citizens for security.
Sympathy for the lawless (the beloved
sinner) is not warranted in denying
equity to the law-abiding, who have a
right to protection from the Republic
which they voluntarily serve and obey.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="The_Virtuous_Victorian">The Virtuous Victorian</h2>
</div>


<p>When Miss Amy Lowell, in her
essay on Émile Verhaeren, says
that the influence of Zola on the younger
writers of France and Belgium was
necessary “to down the long set of sentimental
hypocrisies known in England
as ‘Victorian,’” she repeats a formula
which has been in popular use for many
years, and to which we attach no very
exact significance. “Early-Victorian,”
“mid-Victorian,” we use the phrases
glibly, and without being aware that the
mental attitude to which we refer is
sometimes not Victorian at all, but
Georgian. Take, for example, that fairly
famous sentiment about the British
navy being “if possible, more distinguished
in its domestic virtues than in
its national importance.” Nothing more
oppressively smug was ever uttered in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
the reign of the virtuous Queen; yet
it was written by the most humorous
and most pitiless of Georgian novelists,
and it expressed the conviction of her
soul.</p>

<p>When we permit ourselves to sneer at
Victorian hypocrisies, we allude, as a
rule, to the superficial observance of
religious practices, and to the artificial
reticence concerning illicit sexual relations.
The former affected life more than
it did literature; the latter affected literature
more than it did life. A resolute
silence is apt to imply or involve an
equally resolute denial; and there came a
time when certain plain truths were
denied because there was no other way
of keeping them out of sight. Novelists
and poets conformed to a standard
which was set by the taste of their
day. So profoundly was the great Victorian
laureate influenced by this taste
that he grew reluctant to accept those
simple old English stories, those charming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
old English traditions, the propriety
or impropriety of which had never been
a matter for concern. His “fair Rosamond”
believes herself a wedded wife,
and so escapes culpability. His “Maid
Marian” wanders through Sherwood
Forest under the respectable chaperonage
of her father, and will not permit to
Robin Hood the harmless liberties common
among betrothed lovers.</p>

<p>It is a bit frigid and a bit stilted for
the merry outlaws. “If love were all,”
we might admit that conventionalism
had chilled the laureate’s pen; but, happily
for the great adventures we call life
and death, love is not all. The world
swings on its way, peopled by other
men than lovers; and it is to Tennyson<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
we owe the most splendid denial of
domesticity—and duty—that was
ever made deathless by verse. With
what unequalled ardour his Ulysses
abandons home and country, the faithful,
but ageing, Penelope, the devoted,
but dull, Telemachus, and the troublesome
business of law-making! He does
not covet safety. He does not enjoy the
tranquil reward of his labours, nor the
tranquil discharge of his obligations.
He will drink life to the lees. He will seek
the still untravelled world, and take
what buffets fortune sends him.</p>

<p>Poor Penelope! What chance has she
against such glad decision, such golden
dreams! It is plain that the Ithacan
navy was less distinguished than the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
British navy for the development of
domestic virtues. Until such time as
Germany fulfils her threat, and drives
the “bastard tongue of canting island
pirates” from its hold on the civilized
world, Tennyson’s Ulysses will survive
as the embodiment of the adventurous
spirit which brooks no restraint, and
heeds no liability.</p>

<p>The great Victorian novelists were
well aware that, albeit the average man
does his share of love-making, he neither
lives nor dies for love. Mr. Edmund
Gosse, reared in the strictest sect of
Plymouth Brethren, and professing religion
at ten, was nevertheless permitted
by his father to read the novels of Dickens,
because they dealt with the passion
of love in a humorous manner.
More often they deal with it in a purely
perfunctory manner, recognizing it as
a prelude to marriage, and as something
to which the novelist must not forget to
make an occasional reference. Nicholas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
Nickleby is a young man and a hero.
Consequently an assortment of female
virtues and of female charms is labelled,
docketed, provided with ringlets and a
capacity for appropriate swooning,—and
behold, Nicholas has a wife. Kate
Nickleby’s husband is even more sketchily
outlined. He has a name, and—we
are told—an impetuous and generous
disposition. He makes his appearance
when a suitor is needed, stands up to
be married when a husband is called
for, and that is all there is of him. But
what do these puppets matter in a book
which gives us Mrs. Nickleby, Vincent
Crummles, Fanny Squeers, and the
ever-beloved Kenwigses. It took a great
genius to enliven the hideous picture of
Dotheboys Hall with the appropriate
and immortal Fanny, whom we could
never have borne to lose. It took a great
genius to evolve from nothingness the
name “Morleena Kenwigs.” So perfect
a result, achieved from a mere combination<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
of letters, confers distinction on
the English alphabet.</p>

<p>The charge of conventionalism brought
against Thackeray and Trollope has
more substance, because these novelists
essayed to portray life soberly and
veraciously. “Trollope,” says Sir Leslie
Stephen, “was in the awkward position
of a realist, bound to ignore realities.”
Thackeray was restrained, partly by
the sensitive propriety of British readers
who winced at the frank admission
of sexual infirmities, and partly by the
quality of his own taste. In deference
to the public, he forbore to make Arthur
Pendennis the lover of Fanny Bolton;
and when we remember the gallant part
that Fanny plays when safely settled
at Clavering, her loyalty to her old
friend, Bows, and her dexterity in
serving him, we are glad she went unsmirched
into that sheltered port.</p>

<p>The restrictions so cheerfully accepted
by Thackeray, and his reticence—which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
is merely the reticence observed
by every gentleman of his day—leave
him an uncrippled spectator and analyst
of the complicated business of living.
The world is not nearly so simple a
place as the sexualists seem to consider
it. To the author of “Vanity Fair” it
was not simple at all. Acting and reacting
upon one another, his characters
crowd the canvas, their desires and ambitions,
their successes and failures, inextricably
interwoven into one vast
social scheme. It is not the decency of
Thackeray’s novels which affronts us
(we are seldom unduly aware that they
are decent), but the severity with which
he judges his own creations, and his
rank and shameless favouritism. What
business has he to coddle Rawdon
Crawley (“honest Rawdon,” forsooth!),
to lay siege to our hearts with all the
skill of a great artificer, and compel our
liking for this fool and reprobate? What
business has he to pursue Becky Sharp<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
like a prosecuting attorney, to trip her
up at every step, to betray, to our discomfiture,
his cold hostility? He treats
Blanche Amory in the same merciless
fashion, and no one cares. But Becky!
Becky, that peerless adventuress who,
as Mr. Brownell reminds us, ran her
memorable career before psychology
was thought of as an essential element
of fiction. Becky whose scheming has
beguiled our weary hours, and recompensed
us for the labour of learning to
read. How shall we fathom the mental
attitude of a novelist who could create
such a character, control her fluctuating
fortunes, lift her to dizzy heights,
topple her to ruin, extricate her from
the dust and débris of her downfall,—and
hate her!</p>

<p>Trollope, working on a lower level,
observant rather than creative, was
less stern a moralist than Thackeray,
but infinitely more cautious of his foot-steps.
He kept soberly in the appointed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
path, and never once in thirty years
trod on the grass or flower-beds. Lady
Glencora Palliser thinks, indeed, of
leaving her husband; but she does not do
it, and her continency is rewarded after
a fashion which is very satisfactory to
the reader. Mr. Palliser aspires somewhat
stiffly to be the lover of Lady
Dumbello; but that wise worldling,
ranking love the least of assets, declines
to make any sacrifice at its shrine.
Trollope unhesitatingly and proudly
claimed for himself the quality of harmlessness.
“I do believe,” he said, “that
no girl has risen from the reading of my
pages less modest than she was before,
and that some girls may have learned
from them that modesty is a charm
worth possessing.”</p>

<p>This is one of the admirable sentiments
which should have been left unspoken.
It is a true word as far as it goes,
but more suggestive of “Little Women,”
or “A Summer in Leslie Goldthwaite’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
Life,” than of those virile, varied and
animated novels which make no appeal
to immaturity. In Trollope’s teeming
world, as in the teeming world about us,
a few young people fall in love and are
married, but this is an infrequent episode.
Most of his men and women, like
the men and women whom we know,
are engrossed in other activities. Once,
indeed, Bishop Proudie wooed and won
Mrs. Proudie. Once Archdeacon Grantly
wooed and won Mrs. Grantly. But
neither of these gentlemen could possibly
have belonged to “the great cruising
brotherhood of the Pilgrims of
Love.” “Le culte de la femme” has
never been a popular pastime in Britain,
and Trollope was the last man on the
island to have appreciated its significance.
He preferred politics, the hunting-field,
and the church.</p>

<p>Yet surely Archdeacon Grantly is
worth a brace of lovers. With what sincerity
he is drawn, and with what consummate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
care! A churchman who, as
Sir Leslie Stephen somewhat petulantly
observes, “gives no indication of having
any religious views whatever, beyond a
dislike to dissenters.” A solidly respectable
member of provincial clerical society,
ambitious, worldly, prizing wealth,
honouring rank, unspiritual, unprogressive,—but
none the less a man
who would have proved his worth in the
hour of England’s trial.</p>

<p>It is a testimony to the power of
fiction that, having read with breathless
concern and through countless
pages Mr. Britling’s reflections on
the war, my soul suddenly cried out
within me for the reflections of Archdeacon
Grantly. Mr. Britling is an acute
and sensitive thinker. The archdeacon’s
mental processes are of the simplest.
Mr. Britling has winged his triumphant
flight from “the clumsy, crawling, snobbish,
comfort-loving caterpillar of Victorian
England.” The archdeacon is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
still confessedly a grub. Mr. Britling has
“truckled to no domesticated god.” The
archdeacon’s deity is open to such
grievous innuendoes. Yet I wish I could
have stood on the smooth lawn of Plumstead,
and have heard what the archdeacon
had to say when he learned that
an English scholar and gentleman had
smuggled out of England, by the help
of a female “confidential agent,” a
treacherous appeal to the President of
the United States, asking that pressure
should be brought upon fighting Englishmen
in the interests of peace. I wish
I could have heard the cawing rooks of
Plumstead echo his mighty wrath. For
there is that in the heart of a man, even
a Victorian churchman with a love of
preferment and a distaste for dissenters,
which holds scatheless the sacred thing
called honour.</p>

<p>Trollope is as frank about the archdeacon’s
frailties as Mr. Wells is frank
about Mr. Britling’s frailties. In piping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
days of peace, the archdeacon’s
contempt for Mr. Britling would have
been as sincere and hearty as Mr.
Britling’s contempt for the archdeacon.
But under the hard, heroic discipline of
war there would have come to the archdeacon,
as to Mr. Britling, a white dawn
of revelation. Both men have the liberating
qualities of manhood.</p>

<p>It is always hard to make an elastic
phrase fit with precision. We know what
we mean by Victorian conventions and
hypocrisies, but the perpetual intrusion
of blinding truths disturbs our point of
view. The new Reform bill and the
extension of the suffrage were hardy
denials of convention. “The Origin of
Species” and “Zoölogical Evidences as
to Man’s Place in Nature” were not
published in the interests of hypocrisy.
There was nothing oppressively respectable
about “The Ring and the Book”;
and Swinburne can hardly be said to
have needed correction at Zola’s hands.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
These mid-Victorian products have a
savour of freedom about them, and so
has “The Ordeal of Richard Feverel.”
Even the Homeric eloquence of Ruskin
was essentially the eloquence of the
free. The two lessons he sought to drive
home to his reluctant readers were, first,
that Englishmen were not living on an
illuminated earth spot, under the especial
patronage of the Almighty; and,
second, that no one was called by Providence
to the enjoyment of wealth and
security. If such unpleasant and reiterated
truths—as applicable to the
United States to-day as they were to
Victoria’s England—are “smug,” then
Jeremiah is sugar-coated, and the Baptist
an apostle of ease.</p>

<p>The English have at all times lacked
the courage of their emotions, but not
the emotions themselves. Their reticence
has stood for strength as well as
for stiffness. The pre-Raphaelites, indeed,
surrendered their souls with docility<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
to every wavelet of feeling, and produced
something iridescent, like the
shining of wet sand. Love, according to
their canon, was expressed with transparent
ease. It was “a great but rather
sloppy passion,” says Mr. Ford Madox
Hueffer, “which you swooned about on
broad general lines.” A pre-Raphaelite
corsair languished as visibly as a pre-Raphaelite
seraph. He could be bowled
over by a worsted ball; but he was at
least more vigorous and more ruddy
than a cubist nude. One doubted his
seared conscience and his thousand
crimes; but not his ability to walk unassisted
downstairs.</p>

<p>The Victorian giants were of mighty
girth. They trod the earth with proud
and heavy steps, and with a strength
of conviction which was as vast and
tranquil as the plains. We have parted
with their convictions and with their
tranquillity. We have parted also with
their binding prejudices and with their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
standards of taste. Freedom has come
to us, not broadening down</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“from precedent to precedent,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p0">but swiftly and comprehensively. There
are no more taboos, no more silent or
sentimental hypocrisies. We should now
know a great many interesting details
concerning the Marquis of Steyne and
the Duke of Omnium, if these two imposing
figures had not passed forever
from our ken. We should have searchlights
thrown upon Becky Sharp, if
Becky had not escaped into the gloom.
Her successors sin exhaustively, and
with a lamentable lack of <i>esprit</i>. We
are bidden to scrutinize their transgressions,
but Becky’s least peccadillo is
more engaging than all their broken
commandments. The possibility of profound
tediousness accompanying perfect
candour dawns slowly on the truth-tellers
of fiction. It takes a great artist,
like Edith Wharton, to recognize<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
and deplore “the freedom of speech
which never arrives at wit, and the
freedom of act which never makes for
romance.”</p>

<p>The Michigan magistrate who gave
orders that a stalwart male angel
presiding over the gateway of a cemetery
should be recast in feminine mould may
have been an erring theologian and a
doubtful art-critic; but that he was a

<p class="p0">or of Gabriel the messenger. Holy Writ
was as remote from his mental vision
as was Paradise Lost. He was thinking
very properly of the “angel in the
house,” and this feminine ideal was
affronted by the robust outlines, no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
less than by the robust virtues, associated
with the heavenly host. Cowley’s
soothing compromise, which was designed
as a compliment to a lady, and
which, instead of unsexing angels, endowed
them with a double line of potencies,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">“They are than Man more strong, and more than Woman sweet,”—</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p0">is not easily expressed in art. The very
gallant Michigan gentleman simplified
the situation by eliminating the masculine
element. He registered his profession
of faith in the perfectibility of
women.</p>

<p>It is awkward to be relegated to the
angelic class, and to feel that one does
not fit. Intelligent feminists sometimes
say that chivalry—that inextinguishable
point of view which has for centuries
survived its own death-notices—is
more disheartening than contempt.
Chivalry is essentially protective. It is
rooted in the consciousness of superior<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
strength. It is expansively generous and
scrimpingly just. It will not assure to
women a fair field and no favours,
which is the salvation of all humanity;
but it will protect them from the consequences
of their own deeds, and that
way lies perdition.</p>

<p>Down through the ages we see the
working of this will. Rome denied to
women all civic rights, but allowed
them many privileges. They were not
permitted to make any legal contract.
They were not permitted to bequeath
their own fortunes, or—ordinarily—to
give testimony in court. But they
might plead ignorance of the law, “as
a ground for dissolving an obligation,”
which, if often convenient, was always
demoralizing. Being somewhat contemptuously
absolved from the oath of
allegiance in the Middle Ages, they
were as a consequence immune from
outlawry. On the other hand, the severity
with which they were punished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
for certain crimes which were presumed
to come easy to them—poisoning, husband-murder,
witchcraft (King Jamie
was not the only wiseacre who marvelled
that there should be twenty
witches to one warlock)—is evidence
of fear on the legislators’ part. The oldest
laws, the oldest axioms which antedate
all laws, betray this uneasy sense
of insecurity. “Day and night must
women be held by their protectors in a
state of dependence,” says Manu, the
Hindu Noah, who took no female with
him in his miraculously preserved boat,
but was content with his own safety,
and trusted the continuance of the race
to the care and ingenuity of the gods.</p>

<p>In our day, and in our country, women
gained their rights (I use the word
“rights” advisedly, because, though its
definition be disputed, every one knows
what it implies) after a prolonged, but
not embittered struggle. Certain States
moved so slowly that they were over-taken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
by a Federal Amendment. Even
with the franchise to back them, American
women have a hard time making
their way in the professions, though a
great deal of courtesy is shown them by
professional men. They have a hard
time making their way in trades,
where the unions block their progress.
They have a very small share of political
patronage, and few good positions on
the civil lists. Whether the best interests
of the country will be advanced
or retarded by a complete recognition
of their claims—which implies giving
them an even chance with men—is
a point on which no one can speak
with authority. The absence of data
leaves room only for surmise. Women
are striving to gain this “even chance”
for their own sakes, which is lawful and
reasonable. Their public utterances, it is
true, dwell pointedly on the regeneration
of the world. This also is lawful and
reasonable. Public utterances have <i>always</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
dwelt on the regeneration of the
world, since the apple was eaten and
Paradise closed its gates.</p>

<p>Meanwhile American chivalry, a
strong article and equal to anything
Europe ever produced, clings passionately
and persistently to its inward
vision. Ellen Key speaks casually of
“the vices which men call woman’s
nature.” If Swedish gentlemen permit
themselves this form of speech, it finds
no echo in our loyal land. Two things
an American hates to do,—hold a
woman accountable for her misdeeds,
and punish her accordingly. When
Governor Craig of North Carolina set
aside the death-sentence which had
been passed upon a murderess, and committed
her to prison for life, he gave to
the public this plain and comprehensive
statement: “There is no escape from
the conclusion that Ida Bell Warren
is guilty of murder, deliberate and
premeditated. Germany executed the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
woman spy; England did not. The action
of the military Governor of Belgium
was condemned by the conscience of
the world. The killing of this woman
would send a shiver through North
Carolina.”</p>

<p>Apart from the fact that Edith Cavell
was not a spy, and that her offence was
one which has seldom in the world’s history
been so cruelly punished, Governor
Craig’s words deserve attention. He explicitly
exempted a woman, because she
was a woman, from the penalty which
would have been incurred by a man.
Incidentally he was compelled to commute
the death-sentence of her confederate,
as it was hardly possible to send
the murderous wife to prison, and her
murderous accomplice to the chair.
That the execution of Mrs. Warren
would have sent a “shiver” through
North Carolina is doubtless true. The
Governor had received countless letters
and telegrams protesting against the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
infliction of the death-penalty on a
woman.</p>

<p>One of the reasons which has been
urged for the total abolition of this penalty
is the reluctance of juries to convict
women of crimes punishable by
death. The number of wives who murder
their husbands, and of girls who
murder their lovers, is a menace to society.
Our sympathetic tolerance of these
<i>crimes passionnés</i>, the sensational scenes
in court, and the prompt acquittals
which follow, are a menace to law and
justice. Better that their perpetrators
should be sent to prison, and suffer a
few years of corrective discipline, until
soft-hearted sentimentalists circulate
petitions, and secure their pardon and
release.</p>

<p>The right to be judged as men are
judged is perhaps the only form of
equality which feminists fail to demand.
Their attitude to their own <i>errata</i> is well
expressed in the solemn warning addressed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
by Mr. Louis Untermeyer’s Eve
to the Almighty,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Pause, God, and ponder, ere Thou judgest me!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The right to be punished is not, and has
never been, a popular prerogative with
either sex. There was, indeed, a London
baker who was sentenced in the year
1816 to be whipped and imprisoned for
vagabondage. He served his term; but,
whether from clemency or from oversight,
the whipping was never administered.
When released, he promptly
brought action against the prison authorities
because he had not been
whipped, “according to the statute,”
and he won his case. Whether or not the
whipping went with the verdict is not
stated; but it was a curious joke to play
with the grim realities of British law.</p>

<p>American women are no such sticklers
for a code. They acquiesce in their
frequent immunity from punishment,
and are correspondingly, and very naturally,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
indignant when they find themselves
no longer immune. There was a
pathetic ring in the explanation offered
some years ago by Mayor Harrison of
Chicago, whose policemen were accused
of brutality to female strikers and pickets.
“When the women do anything in
violation of the law,” said the Mayor
to a delegation of citizens, “the police
arrest them. And then, instead of going
along quietly as men prisoners would,
the women sit down on the sidewalks.
What else can the policemen do but lift
them up?”</p>

<p>If men “go along quietly,” it is because
custom, not choice, has bowed
their necks to the yoke of order and
equity. They break the law without
being prepared to defy it. The lawlessness
of women may be due as much to
their long exclusion from citizenship,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Some reverence for the laws ourselves have made,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p0">as to the lenity shown them by men,—a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
lenity which they stand ever ready to
abuse. We have only to imagine what
would have happened to a group of men
who had chosen to air a grievance by
picketing the White House, the speed
with which they would have been arrested,
fined, dispersed, and forgotten,
to realize the nature of the tolerance
granted to women. For months these
female pickets were unmolested. Money
was subscribed to purchase for them
umbrellas and overshoes. The President,
whom they were affronting, sent
them out coffee on cold mornings. It
was only when their utterances became
treasonable, when they undertook to
assure our Russian visitors that Mr.
Wilson and Mr. Root were deceiving
Russia, and to entreat these puzzled
foreigners to help them free our nation,
that their sport was suppressed, and
they became liable to arrest and imprisonment.</p>

<p>Much censure was passed upon the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
unreasonable violence of these women.
The great body of American suffragists
repudiated their action, and the anti-suffragists
used them to point stern
morals and adorn vivacious tales. But
was it quite fair to permit them in the
beginning a liberty which would not
have been accorded to men, and which
led inevitably to licence? Were they not
treated as parents sometimes treat children,
allowing them to use bad language
because, “if you pay no attention to
them, they will stop it of their own accord”;
and then, when they do not stop
it, punishing them for misbehaving before
company? When a sympathetic
gentleman wrote to a not very sympathetic
paper to say that the second
Liberty Loan would be more popular if
Washington would “call off the dogs of
war on women,” he turned a flashlight
upon the fathomless gulf with which
sentimentalism has divided the sexes.
No one dreams of calling policemen and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
magistrates “dogs of war” because they
arrest and punish men for disturbing
the peace. If men claim the privileges of
citizenship, they are permitted to suffer
its penalties.</p>

<p>A few years before the war, a rage for
compiling useless statistics swept over
Europe and the United States. When it
was at its height, some active minds
bethought them that children might be
made to bear their part in the guidance
of the human race. Accordingly a series
of questions—some sensible and some
foolish—were put to English, German,
and American school-children, and their
enlightening answers were given to the
world. One of these questions read:
“Would you rather be a man or a
woman, and why?” Naturally this
query was of concern only to little girls.
No sane educator would ask it of a boy.
German pedagogues struck it off the
list. They said that to ask a child,
“Would you rather be something you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
must be, or something you cannot possibly
be?” was both foolish and useless.
Interrogations concerning choice were
of value only when the will was a determining
factor.</p>

<p>No such logical inference chilled the
examiners’ zeal in this inquisitive land.
The question was asked and was answered.
We discovered, as a result, that
a great many little American girls (a
minority, to be sure, but a respectable
minority) were well content with their
sex; not because it had its duties and
dignities, its pleasures and exemptions;
but because they plainly considered
that they were superior to little American
boys, and were destined, when
grown up, to be superior to American
men. One small New England maiden
wrote that she would rather be a woman
because “Women are always better
than men in morals.” Another, because
“Women are of more use in the world.”
A third, because “Women learn things<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
quicker than men, and have more
intelligence.” And so on through varying
degrees of self-sufficiency.</p>

<p>These little girls, who had no need to
echo the Scotchman’s prayer, “Lord,
gie us a gude conceit o’ ourselves!”
were old maids in the making. They
had stamped upon them in their tender
childhood the hall-mark of the American
spinster. “The most ordinary cause of
a single life,” says Bacon, “is liberty,
especially in certain self-pleasing and
humorous minds.” But it is reserved for
the American woman to remain unmarried
because she feels herself too valuable
to be entrusted to a husband’s
keeping. Would it be possible in any
country save our own for a lady to
write to a periodical, explaining “Why
I am an Old Maid,” and be paid coin of
the realm for the explanation? Would it
be possible in any other country to hear
such a question as “Should the Gifted
Woman Marry?” seriously asked, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
seriously answered? Would it be possible
for any sane and thoughtful woman
who was not an American to consider
even the remote possibility of our spinsters
becoming a detached class, who
shall form “the intellectual and economic
<i>élite</i> of the sex, leaving marriage
and maternity to the less developed
woman”? What has become of the belief,
as old as civilization, that marriage
and maternity are developing processes,
forcing into flower a woman’s latent
faculties; and that the less-developed
woman is inevitably the woman who
has escaped this keen and powerful
stimulus? “Never,” said Edmond de
Goncourt, “has a virgin, young or old,
produced a work of art.” One makes
allowance for the Latin point of view.
And it is possible that M. de Goncourt
never read “Emma.”</p>

<p>There is a formidable lack of humour
in the somewhat contemptuous attitude
of women, whose capabilities have not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
yet been tested, toward men who stand
responsible for the failures of the world.
It denotes, at home and abroad, a density
not far removed from dulness. In
Mr. St. John Ervine’s depressing little
drama, “Mixed Marriage,” which the
Dublin actors played in New York some
years ago, an old woman, presumed to
be witty and wise, said to her son’s betrothed:
“Sure, I believe the Lord made
Eve when He saw that Adam could not
take care of himself”; and the remark
reflected painfully upon the absence of
that humorous sense which we used to
think was the birthright of Irishmen.
The too obvious retort, which nobody
uttered, but which must have occurred
to everybody’s mind, was that if Eve
had been designed as a care-taker, she
had made a shining failure of her job.</p>

<p>That astute Oriental, Sir Rabindranath
Tagore, manifested a wisdom beyond
all praise in his recognition of
American standards, when addressing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
American audiences. As the hour for his
departure drew nigh, he was asked to
write, and did write, a “Parting Wish
for the Women of America,” giving
graceful expression to the sentiments he
knew he was expected to feel. The skill
with which he modified and popularized
an alien point of view revealed the seasoned
lecturer. He told his readers that
“God has sent woman to love the world,”
and to build up a “spiritual civilization.”
He condoled with them because
they were “passing through great sufferings
in this callous age.” His heart
bled for them, seeing that their hearts
“are broken every day, and victims are
snatched from their arms to be thrown
under the car of material progress.” The
Occidental sentiment which regards
man simply as an offspring, and a
fatherless offspring at that (no woman,
says Olive Schreiner, could look upon a
battle-field without thinking, “So many
mothers’ sons!”), came as naturally to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
Sir Rabindranath as if he had been to
the manner born. He was content to
see the passion and pain, the sorrow
and heroism of men, as reflections mirrored
in a woman’s soul. The ingenious
gentlemen who dramatize Biblical narratives
for the American stage, and
who are hampered at every step by
the obtrusive masculinity of the East,
might find a sympathetic supporter in
this accomplished and accommodating
Hindu.</p>

<p>The story of Joseph and his Brethren,
for example, is perhaps the best tale
ever told the world,—a tale of adventure
on a heroic scale, with conflicting
human emotions to give it poignancy
and power. It deals with pastoral simplicities,
with the splendours of court,
and with the “high finance” which
turned a free landholding people into
tenantry of the crown. It is a story of
men, the only lady introduced being a
disedifying <i>dea ex machina</i>, whose popularity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
in Italian art has perhaps blinded
us to the brevity of her Biblical rôle.
But when this most dramatic narrative
was cast into dramatic form, Joseph’s
splendid loyalty to his master, his cold
and vigorous chastity, were nullified by
giving him an Egyptian sweetheart.
Lawful marriage with this young lady
being his sole solicitude, the advances
of Potiphar’s wife were less of a temptation
than an intrusion. The keynote of
the noble old tale was destroyed, to
assure to woman her proper place as
the guardian of man’s integrity.</p>

<p>Still more radical was the treatment
accorded to the parable of the “Prodigal
Son,” which was expanded into a
pageant play, and acted with a hardy
realism permitted only to the strictly
ethical drama. The scriptural setting of
the story was preserved, but its patriarchal
character was sacrificed to modern
sentiment which refuses to be interested
in the relation of father and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
son. Therefore we beheld the prodigal
equipped with a mother and a trusting
female cousin, who, between them, put
the poor old gentleman out of commission,
reducing him to his proper level of
purveyor-in-ordinary to the household.
It was the prodigal’s mother who bade
her reluctant husband give their wilful
son his portion. It was the prodigal’s
mother who watched for him from the
house-top, and silenced the voice of
censure. It was the prodigal’s mother
who welcomed his return, and persuaded
father and brother to receive him into
favour. The whole duty of man in that
Syrian household was to obey the impelling
word of woman, and bestow
blessings and bags of gold according to
her will.</p>

<p>The expansion of the maternal sentiment
until it embraces, or seeks to embrace,
humanity, is the vision of the
emotional, as opposed to the intellectual,
feminist. “The Mother State of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
which we dream” offers no attraction
to many plain and practical workers,
and is a veritable nightmare to others.
“Woman,” writes an enthusiast in the
“Forum,” “means to be, not simply the
mother of the individual, but of society,
of the State with its man-made institutions,
of art and science, of religion and
morals. All life, physical and spiritual,
personal and social, needs to be mothered.”</p>

<p>“Needs to be mothered”! When men
proffer this welter of sentiment in the
name of women, how is it possible to
say convincingly that the girl student
standing at the gates of knowledge is as
humble-hearted as the boy; that she
does not mean to mother medicine, or
architecture, or biology, any more than
the girl in the banker’s office means to
mother finance? Her hopes for the future
are founded on the belief that fresh
opportunities will meet a sure response;
but she does not, if she be sane, measure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
her untried powers by any presumptive
scale of valuation. She does not consider
the advantages which will accrue to
medicine, biology, or architecture by
her entrance—as a woman—into any
one of these fields. Their need for her
maternal ministration concerns her less
than her need for the magnificent heritage
they present.</p>

<p>It has been said many times that the
craving for material profit is not instinctive
in women. If it is not instinctive, it
will be acquired, because every legitimate
incentive has its place in the progress
of the world. The demand that
women shall be paid men’s wages for
men’s work may represent a desire for
justice rather than a desire for gain;
but money fairly earned is sweet in the
hand, and to the heart. An open field,
an even start, no handicap, no favours,
and the same goal for all. This is the
worker’s dream of paradise. Women
have long known that lack of citizenship<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
was an obstacle in their path. Self-love
has prompted them to overrate
their imposed, and underrate their inherent,
disabilities. “Whenever you see
a woman getting a high salary, make up
your mind that she is giving twice the
value received,” writes an irritable correspondent
to the “Survey”; and this
pretension paralyzes effort. To be satisfied
with ourselves is to be at the end of
our usefulness.</p>

<p>M. Émile Faguet, that most radical
and least sentimental of French feminists,
would have opened wide to women
every door of which man holds the key.
He would have given them every legal
right and burden which they are physically
fitted to enjoy and to bear. He
was as unvexed by doubts as he was
uncheered by illusions. He had no more
fear of the downfall of existing institutions
than he had hope for the regeneration
of the world. The equality of men
and women, as he saw it, lay, not in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
their strength, but in their weakness;
not in their intelligence, but in their
stupidity; not in their virtues, but in
their perversity. Yet there was no taint
of pessimism in his rational refusal to be
deceived. No man saw more clearly, or
recognized more justly, the art with
which his countrywomen have cemented
and upheld a social state at once flexible
and orderly, enjoyable and inspiriting.
That they have been the allies, and not
the rulers, of men in building this fine
fabric of civilization was also plain to
his mind. Allies and equals he held them,
but nothing more. “<i>La femme est parfaitement
l’égale de l’homme, mais elle
n’est que son égale.</i>”</p>

<p>Naturally to such a man the attitude
of Americans toward women was as unsympathetic
as was the attitude of
Dahomeyans. He did not condemn it
(possibly he did not condemn the
Dahomeyans, seeing that the civic and
social ideals of France and Dahomey<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
are in no wise comparable); but he explained
with careful emphasis that the
French woman, unlike her American
sister, is not, and does not desire to be,
“<i>un objet sacro-saint</i>.” The reverence
for women in the United States he assumed
to be a national trait, a sort of
national institution among a proud and
patriotic people. “<i>L’idolâtrie de la femme
est une chose américaine par excellence.</i>”</p>

<p>The superlative complacency of American
women is due largely to the oratorical
adulation of American men,—an
adulation that has no more substance
than has the foam on beer. I have heard
a candidate for office tell his female
audience that men are weak and women
are strong, that men are foolish and
women are wise, that men are shallow
and women are deep, that men are submissive
tools whom women, the leaders
of the race, must instruct to vote for
<i>him</i>. He did not believe a word that he
said, and his hearers did not believe that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
he believed it; yet the grossness of his
flattery kept pace with the hypocrisy
of his self-depreciation. The few men
present wore an attitude of dejection,
not unlike that of the little boy in
“Punch” who has been told that he is
made of</p>

<p class="p0">and can “hardly believe it.”</p>

<p>What Mr. Roosevelt called the “lunatic
fringe” of every movement is painfully
obtrusive in the great and noble
movement which seeks fair play for
women. The “full habit of speech” is
never more regrettable than when the
cause is so good that it needs but temperate
championing. “Without the aid
of women, England could not carry on
this war,” said Mr. Asquith in the second
year of the great struggle,—an obvious
statement, no doubt, but simple,
truthful, and worthy to be spoken. Why
should the “New Republic,” in an article<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
bearing the singularly ill-mannered
title, “Thank You For Nothing!” have
heaped scorn upon these words? Why
should its writer have made the angry
assertion that the British Empire had
been “deprived of two generations of
women’s leadership,” because only a
world’s war could drill a new idea into a
statesman’s head? The war has drilled
a great many new ideas into all our
heads. Absence of brain matter could
alone have prevented this infusion. But
“leadership” is a large word. It is not
what men are asking, and it is not what
women are offering, even at this stage of
the game. Partnership is as far as obligation
on the one side and ambition on
the other are prepared to go; and a clear
understanding of this truth has accomplished
great results.</p>

<p>Therefore, when we are told that the
women of to-day are “giving their vitality
to an anæmic world,” we wonder if
the speaker has read a newspaper for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
the past half-dozen years. The passionate
cruelty and the passionate heroism
of men have soaked the earth with blood.
Never, since it came from its Maker’s
hands, has it seen such shame and
glory. There may be some who still believe
that this blood would not have
been spilled had women shared in the
citizenship of nations; but the arguments
they advance in support of an
undemonstrable theory show a soothing
ignorance of events.</p>

<p>“War will pass,” says Olive Schreiner,
“when intellectual culture and activity
have made possible to the female an
equal share in the control and government
of modern national life.” And
why? Because “Arbitration and compensation
will naturally occur to her as
cheaper and simpler methods of bridging
the gaps in national relationship.”</p>

<p>Strange that this idea never “naturally”
occurred to man! Strange that no
delegate to The Hague should have perceived<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
so straight a path to peace!
Strange that when Germany struck her
long-planned, well-prepared blow, this
cheap and simple measure failed to stay
her hand! War will pass when injustice
passes. Never before, unless hope leaves
the world.</p>

<p>That any civilized people should bar
women from the practice of law is to the
last degree absurd and unreasonable.
There never can be an adequate cause
for such an injurious exclusion. There is,
in fact, no cause at all, only an arbitrary
decision on the part of those who
have the authority to decide. Yet nothing
is less worth while than to speculate
dizzily on the part women are going to
play in any field from which they are at
present debarred. They may be ready
to burnish up “the rusty old social organism,”
and make it shine like new;
but this is not the work which lies
immediately at hand. A suffragist who
believes that the world needs house-cleaning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
has made the terrifying statement
that when English women enter
the law courts they will sweep away all
“legal frippery,” all the “accumulated
dust and rubbish of centuries.” Latin
terms, flowing gowns and wigs, silly
staves and worn-out symbols, all must
go, and with them must go the antiquated
processes which confuse and retard
justice. The women barristers of
the future will scorn to have “legal natures
like Portia’s,” basing their claims
on quibbles and subterfuges. They will
cut all Gordian knots. They will deal
with naked simplicities.</p>

<p>References to Portia are a bit disquieting.
Her law was stage law, good
enough for the drama which has always
enjoyed a jurisprudence of its own. We
had best leave her out of any serious
discussion. But why should the admission
of women to the bar result in a
volcanic upheaval? Women have practised
medicine for years, and have not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
revolutionized it. Painstaking service,
rather than any brilliant display of
originality, has been their contribution
to this field. It is reasonable to suppose
that their advance will be resolute and
beneficial. If they ever condescended
to their profession, they do so no longer.
If they ever talked about belonging to
“the class of real people,” they have
relinquished such flowers of rhetoric. If
they have earnestly desired the franchise,
it was because they saw in it justice
to themselves, not the torch which
would enlighten the world.</p>

<p>It is conceded theoretically that woman’s
sphere is an elastic term, embracing
any work she finds herself able to
do,—not necessarily do well, because
most of the world’s work is done badly,
but well enough to save herself from failure.
Her advance is unduly heralded
and unduly criticized. She is the target
for too much comment from friend and
foe. On the one hand, a keen (but of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
course perverted) misogynist like Sir
Andrew Macphail, welcomes her entrance
into public life because it will
tend to disillusionment. If woman can
be persuaded to reveal her elemental
inconsistencies, man, freed in some
measure from her charm—which is the
charm of <i>retenue</i>—will no longer be
subject to her rule. On the other hand,
that most feminine of feminists, Miss
Jane Addams, predicts that “the dulness
which inheres in both domestic and
social affairs when they are carried on
by men alone, will no longer be a necessary
attribute of public life when gracious
and grey-haired women become
part of it.”</p>

<p>If Sir Andrew is as acid as Schopenhauer,
Miss Addams is early Victorian.
Her point of view presupposes a condition
of which we had not been even
dimly aware. Granted that domesticity
palls on the solitary male. Housekeeping
seldom attracts him. The tea-table<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
and the friendly cat fail to arrest his
roving tendencies. Granted that some
men are polite enough to say that they
do not enjoy social events in which
women take no part. They showed no disposition
to relinquish such pastimes until
the arid days of prohibition, and even
now they cling forlornly to the ghost of
a cheerful past. When they assert, however,
that they would have a much better
time if women were present, no one
is wanton enough to contradict them.
But public life! The arena in which
whirling ambition sweeps human souls
as an autumn wind sweeps leaves;
which resounds with the shouts of the
conquerors and the groans of the conquered;
which is degraded by cupidity
and ennobled by achievement; that this
field of adventure, this heated race-track
needs to be relieved from dulness
by the presence and participation of
elderly ladies is the crowning vision of
sensibility.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span></p>

<p>“<i>Qui veut faire l’ange fait la bête</i>,”
said Pascal; and the Michigan angel is
a danger signal. The sentimental and
chivalrous attitude of American men
reacts alarmingly when they are
brought face to face with the actual
terms and visible consequences of woman’s
enfranchisement. There exists a
world-wide and age-long belief that
what women want they get. They must
want it hard enough and long enough to
make their desire operative. It is the listless
and preoccupied unconcern of their
own sex which bars their progress. But
men will fall into a flutter of admiration
because a woman runs a successful
dairy-farm, or becomes the mayor of
a little town; and they will look aghast
upon such commonplace headlines as
these in their morning paper: “Women
Confess Selling Votes”; “Chicago
Women Arrested for Election Frauds”;—as
if there had not always been, and
would not always be, a percentage of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
unscrupulous voters in every electorate.
No sane woman believes that women, as
a body, will vote more honestly than
men; but no sane man believes that
they will vote less honestly. They are
neither the “gateway to hell,” as Tertullian
pointed out, nor the builders of
Sir Rabindranath Tagore’s “spiritual
civilization.” They are neither the repositories
of wisdom, nor the final word
of folly.</p>

<p>It was unwise and unfair to turn a
searchlight upon the first woman in
Congress, and exhibit to a gaping world
her perfectly natural limitations. Such
limitations are common in our legislative
bodies, and excite no particular
comment. They are as inherent in the
average man as in the average woman.
They in no way affect the question of
enfranchisement. Give as much and ask
no more. Give no more and ask as much.
This is the watchword of equality.</p>

<p>“God help women when they have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
only their rights!” exclaimed a brilliant
American lawyer; but it is in the “only”
that all savour lies. Rights and privileges
are incompatible. Emancipation
implies the sacrifice of immunity, the
acceptance of obligation. It heralds the
reign of sober and disillusioning experience.
Women, as M. Faguet reminds us,
are only the equals of men; a truth which
was simply phrased in the old Cornish
adage, “Lads are as good as wenches
when they are washed.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="The_Strayed_Prohibitionist">The Strayed Prohibitionist</h2>
</div>


<p>The image of the prohibition-bred
American youth (not this generation,
but the next) straying through the
wine-drenched and ale-drenched pages of
English literature captivates the fancy.
The classics, to be sure, are equally bibulous;
but with the classics the American
youth has no concern. The advance
guard of educators are busy clearing
away the débris of Greek and Latin
which has hitherto clogged his path.
There is no danger of his learning from
Homer that “Generous wine gives
strength to toiling men,” or from Socrates
that “The potter’s art begins with
the wine jar,” or from the ever-scandalous
Horace that “Wine is mighty to inspire
hope, and to drown the bitterness
of care.” The professor has conspired
with the prohibitionist to save the undergraduate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
from such disedifying sentiments.</p>

<p>As for the Bible, where corn and oil
and wine, the three fruits of a bountiful
harvest, are represented as of equal
virtue, it will probably be needful to
supply such texts with explanatory and
apologetic footnotes. The sweet and
sober counsel of Ecclesiastes: “Forsake
not an old friend, for the new will not
be like to him. A new friend is as new
wine; it shall grow old, and thou shalt
drink it with pleasure,” has made its
way into the heart of humanity, and
has been embedded in the poetry of
every land. But now, like the most
lovely story of the marriage feast at
Cana, it has been robbed of the simplicity
of its appeal. I heard a sermon
preached upon the marriage feast
which ignored the miracle altogether.
The preacher dwelt upon the dignity
and responsibility of the married state,
reprobated divorce, and urged parents<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
to send their children to Sunday school.
It was a perfectly good sermon, filled
with perfectly sound exhortations; but
the speaker “strayed.” Sunday schools
were not uppermost in the holy Mother’s
mind when she perceived and pitied
the humiliation of her friends.</p>

<p>The banishing of the classics, the
careful editing of the Scriptures, and
the comprehensive ignorance of foreign
languages and letters which distinguishes
the young American, leaves only
the field of British and domestic literature
to enlighten or bewilder him.
Now New England began to print books
about the time that men grew restive
as to the definition of temperance. Longfellow
wrote a “Drinking Song” to
water, which achieved humour without
aspiring to it, and Dr. Holmes wrote a
teetotaller’s adaptation of a drinking
song, which aspired to humour without
achieving it. As a matter of fact, no
drinking songs, not even the real ones<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
and the good ones which sparkle in
Scotch and English verse, have any illustrative
value. They come under the
head of special pleading, and are apt to
be a bit defiant. In them, as in the temperance
lecture, “that good sister of
common life, the vine,” becomes an
exotic, desirable or reprehensible according
to the point of view, but never
simple and inevitable, like the olive-tree
and the sheaves of corn.</p>

<p>American letters, coming late in the
day, are virgin of wine. There have
been books, like Jack London’s “John
Barleycorn,” written in the cause of
temperance; there have been pleasant
trifles, like Dr. Weir Mitchell’s “Madeira
Party,” written to commemorate
certain dignified convivialities which
even then were passing silently away;
and there have been chance allusions,
like Mr. Dooley’s vindication of whisky
from the charge of being food: “I
wudden’t insult it be placin’ it on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
same low plain as a lobster salad”; and
his loving recollection of his friend
Schwartzmeister’s cocktail, which was
of such generous proportions that it
“needed only a few noodles to look like
a biled dinner.” But it is safe to say
that there is more drinking in “Pickwick
Papers” than in a library of
American novels. It is drinking without
bravado, without reproach, without
justification. For natural treatment of
a debatable theme, Dickens stands unrivalled
among novelists.</p>

<p>We are told that the importunate virtue
of our neighbours, having broken
one set of sympathies and understandings,
will in time deprive us of meaner
indulgences, such as tobacco, tea, and
coffee. But tobacco, tea, and coffee,
though friendly and compassionate to
men, are late-comers and district-dwellers.
They do not belong to the stately
procession of the ages, like the wine
which Noah and Alexander and Cæsar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
and Praxiteles and Plato and Lord
Kitchener drank. When the Elgin marbles
were set high over the Parthenon,
when the Cathedral of Chartres grew
into beauty, when “Hamlet” was first
played at the Globe Theatre, men lived
merrily and wisely without tobacco,
tea, and coffee, but not without wine.
Tobacco was given by the savage to the
civilized world. It has an accidental
quality which adds to its charm, but
which promises consolation when those
who are better than we want to be have
taken it away from us. “I can understand,”
muses Dr. Mitchell, “the discovery
of America, and the invention of
printing; but what human want, what
instinct, led up to tobacco? Imagine
intuitive genius capturing this noble
idea from the odours of a prairie fire!”</p>

<p>Charles Lamb pleaded that tobacco
was at worst only a “white devil.” But
it was a persecuted little devil which for
years suffered shameful indignities. We<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
have Mr. Henry Adams’s word for it
that, as late as 1862, Englishmen were
not expected to smoke in the house.
They went out of doors or to the stables.
Only a licensed libertine like Monckton
Milnes permitted his guests to smoke
in their rooms. Half a century later,
Mr. Rupert Brooke, watching a designer
in the advertising department of a New
York store making “Matisse-like illustrations
to some notes on summer suitings,”
was told by the superintendent
that the firm gave a “free hand” to its
artists, “except for nudes, improprieties,
and figures of people smoking.” To
these last, some customers—even customers
of the sex presumably interested
in summer suitings—“strongly objected.”</p>

<p>The new school of English fiction
which centres about the tea-table, and
in which, as in the land of the lotus-eaters,
it is always afternoon, affords
an arena for conversation and an easily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
procurable atmosphere. England is the
second home of tea. She waited centuries,
kettle on hob and cat purring
expectantly by the fire, for the coming
of that sweet boon, and she welcomed it
with the generous warmth of wisdom.
No duties daunted her. No price was
too high for her to pay. No risk was
too great to keep her from smuggling
the “China drink.” No hearth was too
humble to covet it, and the homeless
brewed it by the roadside. Isopel Berners,
that peerless and heroic tramp, paid
ten shillings a pound for her tea; and
when she lit her fire in the Dingle, comfort
enveloped Lavengro, and he tasted
the delights of domesticity.</p>

<p>But though England will doubtless
fight like a lion for her tea, as for her
cakes and ale, when bidden to purify
herself of these indulgences, yet it is the
ale, and not the tea, which has coloured
her masterful literature. There are
phrases so inevitable that they defy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
monotony. Such are the “wine-dark
sea” of Greece, and the “nut-brown ale”
of England. Even Lavengro, though he
shared Isopel’s tea, gave ale, “the true
and proper drink of Englishmen,” to
the wandering tinker and his family.
How else, he asks, could he have befriended
these wretched folk? “There
is a time for cold water” [this is a generous
admission on the writer’s part],
“there is a time for strong meat, there
is a time for advice, and there is a time
for ale; and I have generally found that
the time for advice is after a cup of
ale.”</p>

<p>“Lavengro” has been called the epic
of ale; but Borrow was no English
rustic, content with the buxom charms
of malt, and never glancing over her
fat shoulder to wilder, gayer loves. He
was an accomplished wanderer, at home
with all men and with all liquor. He
could order claret like a lord, to impress
the supercilious waiter in a London inn.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
He could drink Madeira with the old
gentleman who counselled the study of
Arabic, and the sweet wine of Cypress
with the Armenian who poured it from
a silver flask into a silver cup, though
there was nothing better to eat with it
than dry bread. When, harried by the
spirit of militant Protestantism, he
peddled his Bibles through Spain, he
dined with the courteous Spanish and
Portuguese Gipsies, and found that
while bread and cheese and olives comprised
their food, there was always a
leathern bottle of good white wine to
give zest and spirit to the meal. He
offered his brandy-flask to a Genoese
sailor, who emptied it, choking horribly,
at a draught, so as to leave no drop for a
shivering Jew who stood by, hoping for
a turn. Rather than see the Christian
cavalier’s spirits poured down a Jewish
throat, explained the old boatman
piously, he would have suffocated.</p>

<p>Englishmen drank malt liquor long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
before they tasted sack or canary. The
ale-houses of the eighth century bear a
respectable tradition of antiquity, until
we remember that Egyptians were
brewing barley beer four thousand years
ago, and that Herodotus ascribes its
invention to the ingenuity and benevolence
of Isis. Thirteen hundred years
before Christ, in the time of Seti I, an
Egyptian gentleman complimented Isis
by drinking so deeply of her brew that
he forgot the seriousness of life, and we
have to-day the record of his unseemly
gaiety. Xenophon, with notable lack of
enthusiasm, describes the barley beer of
Armenia as a powerful beverage, “agreeable
to those who were used to it”; and
adds that it was drunk out of a common
vessel through hollow reeds,—a commendable
sanitary precaution.</p>

<p>In Thomas Hardy’s story, “The Shepherd’s
Christening,” there is a rare tribute
paid to mead, that glorious intoxicant
which our strong-headed, stout-hearted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
progenitors drank unscathed.
The traditional “heather ale” of the
Picts, the secret of which died with the
race, was a glorified mead.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Fra’ the bonny bells o’ heather</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">They brewed a drink lang-syne,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">’Twas sweeter far than honey,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">’Twas stronger far than wine.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The story goes that, after the bloody
victory of the Scots under Kenneth
MacAlpine, in 860, only two Picts who
knew the secret of the brew survived
the general slaughter. Some say they
were father and son, some say they
were master and man. When they were
offered their lives in exchange for the
recipe, the older captive said he dared
not reveal it while the younger lived,
lest he be slain in revenge. So the Scots
tossed the lad into the sea, and waited
expectantly. Then the last of the Picts
cried, “I only know!” and leaped into
the ocean and was drowned. It is a
brave tale. One wonders if a man would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
die to save the secret of making milk-toast.</p>

<p>From the pages of history the prohibition-bred
youth may glean much off-hand
information about the wine which
the wide world made and drank at every
stage of civilization and decay. If, after
the fashion of his kind, he eschews
history, there are left to him encyclopædias,
with their wealth of detail,
and their paucity of intrinsic realities.
Antiquarians also may be trusted to
supply a certain number of papers on
“leather drinking-vessels,” and “toasts
of the old Scottish gentry.” But if the
youth be one who browses untethered
in the lush fields of English literature,
taking prose and verse, fiction and fact,
as he strays merrily along, what will
he make of the hilarious company in
which he finds himself? What of Falstaff,
and the rascal, Autolycus, and of
Sir Toby Belch, who propounded the
fatal query which has been answered in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
1919? What of Herrick’s “joy-sops,”
and “capring wine,” and that simple
and sincere “Thanksgiving” hymn
which takes cognizance of all mercies?</p>

<p>The lines sound like an echo of Saint
Chrysostom’s wise warning, spoken
twelve hundred years before: “Wine is
for mirth, and not for madness.”</p>

<p>Biographies, autobiographies, memoirs,
diaries, all are set with traps
for the unwary, and all are alike unconscious
of offence. Here is Dr. Johnson,
whose name alone is a tonic for
the morally debilitated, saying things
about claret, port, and brandy which
bring a blush to the cheek of temperance.
Here is Scott, that “great good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
man” and true lover of his kind, telling
a story about a keg of whisky and a
Liddesdale farmer which one hardly
dares to allude to, and certainly dares
not repeat. Here is Charles Lamb,
that “frail good man,” drinking more
than is good for him; and here is
Henry Crabb Robinson, a blameless,
disillusioned, prudent sort of person,
expressing actual regret when Lamb
ceases to drink. “His change of habit,
though it on the whole improves his
health, yet, when he is low-spirited,
leaves him without a remedy or relief.”</p>

<p>John Evelyn and Mr. Pepys witnessed
the blessed Restoration, when England
went mad with joy, and the fountains
of London ran wine.</p>

<p class="p0">time it was, until the gilt began to wear
off the gingerbread. But Evelyn, though
he feasted as became a loyal gentleman,
and admitted that canary carried to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
West Indies and back for the good of its
health was “incomparably fine,” yet
followed Saint Chrysostom’s counsel.
He drank, and compelled his household
to drink, with sobriety. There is real
annoyance expressed in the diary when
he visits a hospitable neighbour, and
his coachman is so well entertained in
the servants’ hall that he falls drunk
from the box, and cannot pick himself
up again.</p>

<p>Poor Mr. Pepys was ill fitted by a
churlish fate for the simple pleasures
that he craved. To him, as to many
another Englishman, wine was precious
only because it promoted lively conversation.
His “debauches” (it pleased
him to use that ominous word) were
very modest ones, for he was at all
times prudent in his expenditures. But
claret gave him a headache, and Burgundy
gave him the stone, and late
suppers, even of bread and butter and
botargo, gave him indigestion. Therefore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
he was always renouncing the
alleviations of life, only to be lured
back by his incorrigible love of companionship.
There is a serio-comic
quality in his story of the two bottles
of wine he sent for to give zest to his
cousin Angler’s supper at the Rose
Tavern, and which were speedily emptied
by his cousin Angler’s friends:
“And I had not the wit to let them
know at table that it was I who paid
for them, and so I lost my thanks.”</p>

<p>If the young prohibitionist be light-hearted
enough to read Dickens, or
imaginative enough to read Scott, or
sardonic enough to read Thackeray, he
will find everybody engaged in the great
business of eating and drinking. It
crowds love-making into a corner, being,
indeed, a pleasure which survives
all tender dalliance, and restores to the
human mind sanity and content. I am
convinced that if Mr. Galsworthy’s
characters ate and drank more, they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
would be less obsessed by sex, and I
wish they would try dining as a restorative.</p>

<p>The older novelists recognized this
most expressive form of realism, and
knew that, to be accurate, they must
project their minds into the minds of
their characters. It is because of their
sympathy and sincerity that we recall
old Osborne’s eight-shilling Madeira,
and Lord Steyne’s White Hermitage,
which Becky gave to Sir Pitt, and the
brandy-bottle clinking under her bed-clothes,
and the runlet of canary which
the Holy Clerk of Copmanhurst found
secreted conveniently in his cell, and
the choice purl which Dick Swiveller
and the Marchioness drank in Miss
Sally Brass’s kitchen. We hear Warrington’s
great voice calling for beer,
we smell the fragrant fumes of burning
rum and lemon-peel when Mr. Micawber
brews punch, we see the foam on the
“Genuine Stunning” which the child<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
David calls for at the public house. No
writer except Peacock treats his characters,
high and low, as royally as does
Dickens; and Peacock, although British
publishers keep issuing his novels in
new and charming editions, is little
read on this side of the sea. Moreover,
he is an advocate of strong drink, which
is very reprehensible, and deprives him
of candour as completely as if he had
been a teetotaller. We feel and resent
the bias of his mind; and although he
describes with humour that pleasant
middle period, “after the Jacquerie
were down, and before the march of
mind was up,” yet the only one of his
stories which is innocent of speciousness
is “The Misfortunes of Elphin.”</p>

<p>Now to the logically minded “The
Misfortunes of Elphin” is a temperance
tract. The disaster which ruins the
countryside is the result of shameful
drunkenness. The reproaches levelled
by Prince Elphin at Seithenyn ap<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
Seithyn are sterner and more deeply
deserved than the reproaches levelled by
King Henry at Falstaff; yet the tale
rocks and reels with Seithenyn’s potations.
There are drunkards whom we
can conceive of as sober, but he is not
one of them. There are sinners who
can be punished or pardoned, but he is
not one of them. As he is incapable of
reform, so is he immune from retribution.
Out of the dregs of his folly ooze
the slow words of his wisdom. Nature
befriends him because he is a natural
force, and man submits to him because
he is fulfilling his natural election. The
good and the wicked fret about him,
and grow old in the troublesome process;
but he remains unchangeably,
immutably drunk. “Wine is my medicine,”
he says with large simplicity,
“and my measure is a little more.”</p>

<p>If ever the young prohibitionist strays
into the wine-cellar of Seithenyn ap
Seithyn, he will have a shell-shock. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
may even be that his presence will sour
the casks, as the presence of a woman
is reputed to sour the casks in the great
caves of the Gironde, where wine
ripens slowly, acquiring merit in silence
and seclusion like a Buddhist saint,
and as sensitive as a Buddhist saint to
the perilous proximity of the feminine.
This ancient and reasonable tradition
is but one phase of the ancient and
reasonable hostility between intoxicants
and the sober sex, which dates perhaps
from the time when Roman women were
forbidden to taste their husbands’ wine,
but were fed on sweet syrups, like warm
soda-fountain beverages, to the ruin of
their health and spirits. Small wonder if
they handed down to their great-grand-daughters
a legitimate antagonism to
pleasures they were not permitted to
share, and if their remote descendants
still cherish a dim, resentful consciousness
of hurt. It was the lurking ghost
of a dead tyranny which impelled an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
American woman to write to President
Roosevelt, reproving him for having
proposed a toast to Mr. John Hay’s
daughter on her wedding-day. “Think,”
she said, “of the effect on your friends,
on your children, on your immortal
soul, of such a thoughtless act.”</p>

<p>Nomadic tribes—the vigilant ones
who looked well ahead—wisely forbade
the cultivation of the vine. Their
leaders knew that if men made wine,
they would want to stay at home and
drink it. The prohibition-bred youth,
if he is to remain faithful to the customs
of his people, had better not cultivate
too sedulously the great literature,
smelling of hop-fields, and saturated
with the juice of the grape. Every step
of the way is distracting and dangerous.
When I was a school-girl I was authoritatively
bidden—only authority could
have impelled me—to strengthen my
errant mind by reading the “Areopagitica.”
There I found this amazing sentence:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
“They are not skilful considerers
of human things who imagine to remove
sin by removing the matter of sin.”</p>

<p>But then Milton wrote “L’Allegro.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Money">Money</h2>
</div>


<p>“As the world is, and will be, ’tis a
sort of duty to be rich,” wrote
Lady Mary Wortley Montagu; and her
words—which sound almost ascetic
in our ears—were held to be of doubtful
morality in the godless eighteenth
century which she adorned and typified.
Even Lady Mary endeavoured to qualify
their greed by explaining that she
valued money because it gave her the
power to do good; but her hard-headed
compatriots frankly doubted this excusatory
clause. They knew perfectly
well that a desire to do good is not, and
never has been, a motive power in the
acquisition of wealth.</p>

<p>Lady Mary did render her country
one inestimable service; but her
fortune (which, after all, was of no
great magnitude) had nothing whatever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
to do with it. Intelligent observation,
dauntless courage, and the supreme
confidence which nerved her to experiment
upon her own child,—these
qualities enabled her to force inoculation
upon a reluctant and scandalized public.
These qualities have lifted mankind
out of many a rut, and are all we
shall have to depend on while the world
rolls on its way. When Aristotle said
that money was barren, he did not mean
that it was barren of delights; but that
it had no power to get us to any place
worth reaching, no power to quicken
the intellectual and spiritual potencies
of the soul.</p>

<p>The love of gold, the craving for
wealth, has not lain dormant for ages
in the human heart, waiting for the
twentieth century to call it into being.
It is no keener now than it has always
been, but it is ranker in its growth and
expression, being a trifle over-nourished
in our plethoric land, and not subjected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
to keen competing emotions. Great
waves of religious thought, great struggles
for principles and freedom, great
births of national life, great discoveries,
great passions, and great wrongs,—these
things have swayed the world,
wrecking and saving the souls of men
without regard for money. Great qualities,
too, have left their impress upon
the human race, and endowed it for all
the years to come.</p>

<p>The genius which in the thirteenth
century found expression in architecture
and scholasticism, which in the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries
found expression in art and letters, finds
expression to-day in applied science
and finance. Industrial capitalism, as
we know it now, is the latest development
of man’s restless energy. It has
coloured our times, given us new values
in education, and intruded itself grossly
into the quiet places of life. We should
bear with it patiently, we might even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
“admire it from afar,” if only we were
sometimes suffered to forget. “Money
talks,” and, by way of encouraging its
garrulity, we talk about money, and in
terms of money, until it would sometimes
appear as if the currency of the
United States were the only thing in the
country vital enough to interpret every
endeavour, and illustrate every situation.</p>

<p>Here, for example, is an imposing picture
in a Sunday paper, a picture full of
dignified ecclesiastics and decorous spectators.
The text reads, “Breaking ground
for a three-million-dollar nave.” It is a
comprehensive statement, and one that
conveys to the public the only circumstance
which the public presumably
cares to hear. But it brings a great
cathedral down to the level of the million-dollar
club-houses, or boat-houses,
or fishing-camps which are described
for us in unctuous and awe-stricken
paragraphs. It is even dimly suggestive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
of the million-dollar babies whom reporters
follow feverishly up and down
Palm Beach, and who will soon have to
be billion-dollar babies if they want to
hold their own. We are now on terms
of easy familiarity with figures which
used to belong to the abstractions of
arithmetic, and not to the world of life.
We have become proudly aware of the
infinite possibilities of accumulation and
of waste.</p>

<p>For this is the ebb and flow of American
wealth. It is heaped up with resistless
energy and concentration; it is dissipated
in broken and purposeless profusion.
Every class resents the extravagance
of every other class; but none will
practise denial. The millionaire who
plays with a yacht and decks his wife
with pearls looks askance upon the motor
and silk shirt of the artisan. The artisan,
with impulses and ambitions as ignoble
and as unintelligent as the millionaire’s,
is sullenly aware that, waste as he may,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
the rich can waste more, and he is still
dissatisfied. There is no especial appeal
to manhood in a silk shirt, no approach
to sweetness and light. It represents an
ape-like imitation of something not
worth imitating, a hopeless ignorance
of the value and worth of money.</p>

<p>A universal reluctance to practise
economy indicates a weakness in the
moral fibre of a nation, a dangerous
absence of pride. There is no power of the
soul strong enough to induce thrift but
pride. There is no quality stern enough
to bar self-indulgence but the overmastering
dictates of self-respect. There
is no joy that life can yield comparable
to the joy of independence. A nation is
free when it submits to coercion from
no other nation. A man is free when he
is the arbiter of his own fate. National
and individual freedom have never
come cheap. The sacrifice which insures
the one insures the other; the
resolution which preserves the one preserves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
the other. When Andrew Marvell
declined the bribe offered him
“out of pure affection” by the Lord
Treasurer, saying he had “a bladebone
of mutton” in his cupboard which
would suffice for dinner, he not only
held his own honour inviolate, but he
vindicated the liberty of letters, the
liberty of Parliament, and the liberty of
England. No wonder an old chronicler
says that his integrity and spirit were
“dreadful” to the corrupt officials of
his day.</p>

<p>There are Americans who appear to
love their country for much the same
reason that Stevenson’s “child” loves
the “friendly cow”:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“She gives me cream with all her might</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To eat with apple tart.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>When the supply of cream runs short,
the patriot’s love runs shorter. He holds
virulent mass-meetings to complain of
the cow, of the quality of the cream, and
of its distribution. If he be an immigrant,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
he probably riots in the streets, not
clamouring for the flesh-pots of Egypt—that
immemorial cry for ease and bondage—inasmuch
as the years of his
thraldom had been softened by no such
indulgence; but simply because the
image of the cow is never absent from
his mind, or from the minds of those to
whom he looks for guidance. The captain
of industry and the agitator, the spendthrift
and the spendthrift’s wife who
fling their money ostentatiously to the
four winds of heaven, the working-man
and the working-woman who exact the
largest wage for the least labour, all are
actuated by the same motive,—to get
as much and to give as little as they can.
It is not a principle which makes for
citizenship, and it will afford no great
help in the hour of the nation’s trial.
Material progress and party politics are
engrossing things; but perhaps Francis
Parkman was right when he said that if
our progress is to be at the mercy of our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
politics, and our politics at the mercy
of our mobs, we shall have no lasting
foundation for prosperity and well-being.</p>

<p>The tendency to gloat over the sight
and sound of money may be less pervasive
than it seems. It may be only a
temporary predisposition, leaving us at
heart clean, wise, and temperate. But
there is a florid exuberance in the handling
of this recurrent theme which nauseates
us a little, like very rich food
eaten in a close room. Why should we
be told that “the world gapes in wonder”
as it contemplates “an Aladdin romance
of steel and gold”? The world has had
other things to gape over in these sorrowful
and glorious years. “Once a barefoot
boy, now riding in a hundred-thousand-dollar
private car.” There is a headline
to catch the public eye, and make
the public tongue hang watering from
its mouth. That car, “early Pullman
and late German Lloyd,” is to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
American reader what the two thousand
black slaves with jars of jewels upon their
heads were to Dick Swiveller,—a vision
of tasteful opulence. More intimate
journalists tell us that a “Financial
Potentate” eats baked potatoes for his
luncheon, and gives his friends notebooks
with a moral axiom on each page.
We cannot really care what this unknown
gentleman eats. We cannot,
under any conceivable circumstance,
covet a moral notebook. Yet such items
of information would not be painstakingly
acquired unless they afforded some
mysterious gratification to their readers.</p>

<p>As for the “athletic millionaires,”
who sport in the open like—and often
with—ordinary men, they keep their
chroniclers nimble. Fashions in plutocracy
change with the changing times.
The reporter who used to be turned
loose in a nabob’s private office, and
who rapturously described its “ebony
centre-table on which is laid a costly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
cover of maroon-coloured silk plush,”
and its panelled walls, “the work of
a lady amateur of great ability” (I
quote from a newspaper of 1890), now
has to scurry round golf-links, and
shiver on the outskirts of a polo-field.
From him we learn that young New
Yorkers, the least and lowest of whom
lives in a nine-hundred-thousand-dollar
house, play tennis and golf like
champions, or “cut a wide swathe in
polo circles with their fearless riding.”
From him we learn that “automobile
racing can show its number of millionaires,”
as if it were at all likely to show
its number of clerks and ploughmen.
Extravagance may be the arch-enemy
of efficiency, but it is, and has always
been, the friend of aimless excess.</p>

<p>When I was young, and millionaires
were a rarity in my unassuming town,
a local divine fluttered our habitual
serenity by preaching an impassioned
sermon upon a local Crœsus. He was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
but a moderate sort of Crœsus, a man
of kindly nature and simple vanities,
whom his townspeople had been in
the habit of regarding with mirthful
and tolerant eyes. Therefore it was a
bit startling to hear—from the pulpit—that
this amiable gentleman was “a
crown of glory upon the city’s brow,”
and that his name was honoured
“from the Golden Gate to New Jersey’s
silver sands.” It was more than
startling to be called upon to admire
the meekness with which he trod the
common earth, and the unhesitating
affability with which he bowed to
all his acquaintances, “acknowledging
every salute of civility or respect,”
because, “like another Frederick II
of Prussia,” he felt his fellow-citizens
to be human beings like himself. This
admission into the ranks of humanity,
however gratifying to our self-esteem,
was tempered by so many exhortations
to breathe our millionaire’s name<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
with becoming reverence, and was accompanied
by such a curious medley of
Bible texts, and lists of distinguished
people whom the millionaire had entertained,
that we hardly knew where
we stood in the order of creation.</p>

<p>Copies of this sermon, which was
printed “in deference to many importunities,”
are now extremely rare.
Reading its yellow pages, we become
aware that the rites and ceremonies
with which one generation worships its
golden calf differ in detail from the
rites and ceremonies with which another
generation performs this pious duty.
The calf itself has never changed since
it was first erected in the wilderness,—the
original model hardly admitting
of improvement. Ruskin used to point
out gleefully a careless couple who, in
Claude’s picture of the adoration of the
golden calf, are rowing in a pleasure
boat on a stream which flows mysteriously
through the desert. Indifferent to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
gold, uninterested in idolatry, this pair
glide smoothly by; and perhaps the
river of time bears them through centuries
of greed and materialism to some
hidden haven of repose.</p>

<p>Saint Thomas Aquinas defines the
sin of avarice as a “desire to acquire or
retain in undue measure, beyond the
order of reason.” Possibly no one has
ever believed that he committed this
sin, that there was anything unreasonable
in his desires, or undue in their
measure of accomplishment. “Reason”
is a word of infinite flexibility. The statisticians
who revel in mathematical
intricacies tell us that Mr. John D.
Rockefeller’s income is one hundred
dollars a minute, and that his yearly
income exceeds the lifetime earnings of
two thousand average American citizens,
and is equivalent to the income of fifty
average American citizens sustained
throughout the entire Christian era. It
sounds more bewildering than seductive,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
and the breathless rush of a hundred
dollars a minute is a little like the
seven dinners a day which Alice in
Wonderland stands ready to forego
as a welcome punishment for misbehaviour.
But who shall say that a
hundred dollars a minute is beyond the
“order of reason”? Certainly Saint
Thomas did not refer to incomes of
this range, inasmuch as his mind
(though not without a quality of
vastness) could never have embraced
their possibility.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Mr. Rockefeller
is responsible for the suggestion that
Saint Paul, were he living to-day, would
be a captain of industry. Here again a
denial is as valueless as an assertion. It
is much the habit of modern propagandists—no
matter what their propaganda
may be—to say that the gap between
themselves and the Apostles is
merely a gap of centuries, and that the
unlikeness, which seems to us so vivid,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
is an unlikeness of time and circumstance,
not of the inherent qualities of
the soul. The multiplication of assets,
the destruction of trade-rivalry, formed—apparently—no
part of the original
apostolic programme. If the tent-maker
of Tarsus coveted wealth, he certainly
went the wrong way about getting it.
If there was that in his spirit which corresponded
to the modern instinct for
accumulation, he did great injustice to
his talents, wasting his incomparable
energy on labours which—from his
own showing—left him too often homeless,
and naked, and hungry. Even the
tent-making, by which he earned his
bread, appears to have been valuable to
him for the same reason that the bladebone
of mutton was valuable to Andrew
Marvell,—not so much because it
filled his stomach, as because it insured
his independence.</p>

<p>“<i>L’amour d’argent a passé en dogme de
morale publique</i>,” wrote George Sand,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
whose words have now and then a
strange prophetic ring. The “peril of
prosperity,” to borrow President Hibben’s
alliterative phrase, was not in her
day the menace it is in ours, nor has it
ever been in her land the menace it has
been in ours, because of the many other
perils, not to speak of other interests
and other ideals, filling the Frenchman’s
mind. But if George Sand perceived a
growing candour in the deference paid
to wealth, to wealth as an abstraction
rather than to its possessor, a dropping
of the old hypocrisies which made a pretence
of doubt and disapproval, a development
of honoured and authorized
avarice, she was a close observer as well
as a caustic commentator.</p>

<p>The artlessness of our American attitude
might disarm criticism were anything
less than public sanity at stake.
We appeal simply and robustly to the
love of gain, and we seldom appeal in
vain. It is not only that education has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
substituted the principle of getting on
for less serviceable values; but we are
bidden to purchase marketable knowledge,
no less than marketable foodstuffs,
as an easy avenue to fortune. If
we will eat and drink the health-giving
comestibles urged upon us, our improved
digestions will enable us to earn larger
incomes. If we will take a highly commended
course of horse-shoeing or
oratorio-writing, prosperity will be our
immediate reward. If we will buy some
excellent books of reference, they will
teach us to grow rich.</p>

<p>“There are one thousand more millionaires
in the United States than there
were ten years ago,” say the purveyors
of these volumes. “At the present rate
of increase, the new millionaires in the
next few years will be at least twelve
hundred. <i>Will you be one of them?</i>”
There is a question to ask a young
American at the outset of his career!
There is an incentive to study! And by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
way of elucidating a somewhat doubtful
situation, the advertisers go on to
say: “Typical men of brains are those
who have dug large commercial enterprises
out of a copper mine, or transformed
buying and selling into an art.
You must take a leaf from the experience
of such men if you would hold
positions of responsibility and power.”</p>

<p>Just how the reference books—chill
avenues of universal erudition—are
going to give us control of a copper mine
or of a department store is not made
clear; but their vendors know that there
is no use in offering anything less than
wealth, or, as it is sometimes spelled,
“success,” as a return for the price of
the volumes. And if a tasteful border
design of fat money-bags scattering a
cascade of dollars fails to quicken the
sales, there is no tempting the heart of
man. Our covetousness is as simple and
as easily played upon as was the covetousness
of the adventurers who went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
digging for buried treasures on the
unimpeachable authority of a soothsayer.
The testimony offered in a New
Jersey court that a man had bought
some farmland because the spirit of a
young negro girl had indicated that
there was money hidden beneath the
soil; the arraignment before a Brooklyn
magistrate of two Gipsy women, charged
with stealing the cash they had been
commissioned to “bless,” are proof, if
proof were needed, that intelligence has
not kept pace with cupidity.</p>

<p>The endless stories about messenger
boys and elevator men who have been
given a Wall Street “tip,” and who have
become capitalists in a day, are astonishingly
like the stories which went their
round when the South-Sea Bubble hung
iridescent over London. Mankind has
never wearied of such tales since Aladdin
(one of Fortune’s fools) won his
easy way to wealth. Even the old dime
novel with “Dare-Devil Dick,” or “Jasper,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
the Boy Detective,” for a hero, has
been transmogrified into a “Fame and
Fortune,” series, with “Boys That
Make Money,” figuring vaingloriously
on the title-page. Gone is the Indian
brave, the dauntless young seaman who
saved the American navy, the calm-eyed
lad who held up a dozen masked
ruffians with one small pistol. In their
place we have the boy in the broker’s
office who finds out that “A. and C.”
stock will double its value within ten
days; or the exploits of a group of juvenile
speculators, who form a “secret
syndicate,” and outwit the wisest heads
on Wall Street. The supremacy of youth—a
vital feature of such fiction—is indicated
when the inspired messenger
boy gives a “pointer” to an old and influential
firm of brokers, who receive it
with glistening eyes and respectful gratitude.
“I did not tip you in expectation
of any compensation,” observes the
magnanimous and up-to-date young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
hero. “I simply felt it was my duty to
prevent you from losing the profit that
was bound to come your way if you held
on a few days longer.”</p>

<p>Our newspapers have told us (we
should like to know who told the newspapers)
that high prices are popular
prices. It is fitting and proper that people
who own the wealth of the world
should pay a great deal for everything
they buy. Shoppers with their purses
full of money are affronted by any hint
of cheapness or economy. This may be
true, though it reminds me a little of a
smiling Neapolitan who once assured
me that his donkey liked to be beaten.
One cannot, without entering into the
mind of a donkey or of a rich American,
deny the tastes imputed to them; but
one may cherish doubts. It is true that
“record prices” have been paid for
every luxury, that the sales of furriers
and jewellers have been unprecedented
in the annals of our commerce, that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
eager buying of rare books, pictures,
and curios, flung on the markets by the
destitution of Europe, has never been
surpassed. One might wish that destitution
anywhere (Vienna is not so far
from New York that no cry of pain can
reach us) would dim our pleasure in
such purchases. This does not seem to
be the case. “’Tis man’s perdition to
be safe,” and ’tis his deepest and deadliest
perdition to profit by the misfortunes
of others.</p>

<p>An American rhapsodist, singing the
pæan of money in the pages of the
“Bankers’ Magazine,” says in its mighty
name: “I am the minister of war and the
messenger of peace. No army can march
without my command. Until I speak,
no ship of trade can sail from any port.”</p>

<p>“Until I speak”! Always the emphasis
upon that powerful voice which is so
mute and inglorious without the compelling
mind of man. When President
Cleveland said that if it took every dollar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
in the Treasury, and every soldier
in the United States army, to deliver a
postal card in Chicago, that postal card
should be delivered, he was perhaps glad
to think that the nation’s wealth, like
the nation’s force, could be used to fulfil
the nation’s obligations. But back of
wealth, and back of force, was purpose.
When man lays hand upon the “hilt of
action,” money stops talking and obeys.</p>

<p>Mr. Shane Leslie, shrinking sensitively
from that oppressive word, “efficiency,”
and seeking what solace he can
find in the survival of unpractical ideals,
ventures to say that every university
man “carries away among the husks of
knowledge the certainty that there are
less things saleable in heaven and earth
than the advocates of sound commercial
education would suppose.” This
truth, more simply phrased by the
Breton peasant woman who said “<i>Le
bon Dieu ne vend pas ses biens</i>,” has
other teachers besides religion and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
classics. History, whether we read it or
live in it, makes nothing clearer. Mr.
Henry Ford is credited with saying that
he would not give a nickel for all the
history in the world; but though he can,
and does, forbear to read it, he has to
live in it with the rest of us, and learn
its lessons first-hand. No one desired the
welfare—or what he conceived to be
the welfare—of mankind more sincerely
than he did; and he was prepared
to buy it at a handsome figure. Yet
Heaven refused to sell, and earth, inasmuch
as the souls of men are not <i>her</i>
possessions, had nothing worth his purchase.</p>

<p>The price of war can be computed in
figures; the price of peace calls for another
accountant. The tanker, Gold
Shell, which first crossed the “forbidden”
zone did more than a score of
peace ships could have done to secure
the civilization of the world. Its plain
sailors who put something (I don’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
know what they called it) above personal
safety, and their plain captain
who expressed in the regrettable language
of the sea his scorn of German
pirates, were prepared to pay a higher
price than any millionaire could offer
for their own and their country’s freedom.
We know what these men risked
because we know what agonizing deaths
the sailors on the tanker, Healdton, suffered
at Germany’s hands. The Gold
Shell seamen knew it too, and met frightfulness
with fearlessness. The world is
never so bad but that men’s souls can
rise above its badness, and restore our
fainting faith.</p>

<p>Mohammed prayed that he might be
found among the poor on the Judgment
Day,—a prayer echoed by Saint Bernard,
who took some pains to insure its
being answered. Yet, as a mere abstraction,
of what worth is poverty? The
jewel in the toad’s head is as glittering
as adversity is sweet. One has been well<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
likened to the other. Bishop Lawrence,
undismayed by the most humiliating
page of our country’s history, seized a
crucial moment in which to say very
simply and gallantly that Americans
are not wedded to ease, or enthralled by
wealth. The time has come to prove
him in the right. God will not sell us
safety. We learned this much in the
winter of 1917, when we dug our mail
out of an American steamer, and asked
Britain—Britain burdened with debt
and bleeding at every pore—to carry
it over the sea. For our own sake, no
less than for the world’s sake, we must
show that we coin money in no base
spirit, that we cherish it with no base
passion. The angel who looked too long
at heaven’s golden pavement was flung,
into hell.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Cruelty_and_Humour">Cruelty and Humour</h2>
</div>


<p>The unhallowed alliance between
the cruelty that we hate and the
humour that we prize is a psychological
problem which frets the candid mind.
Hazlitt analyzed it pitilessly, but without
concern, because humanity was not
his playing card. No writer of the nineteenth
century dared to be so clearly
and consciously inhumane as was Hazlitt.
Shakespeare and Scott recognized
this alliance, and were equally unconcerned,
because they accepted life on its
own terms, and were neither the sport
of illusions nor the prey of realities. It
took the public—always more or less
kind-hearted—two hundred years to
sympathize with the wrongs of Shylock,
and three hundred years to wince
at the misery of Malvolio.</p>

<p>It was with something akin to regret<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
that Andrew Lang watched the shrivelling
of that “full-blown comic sense”
which accompanied the cruel sports of
an earlier generation, the bull-baiting
and badger-drawing and cock-fights and
prize-fights which Englishmen loved,
and which taught them to value courage
and look unmoved on pain. In 1699
the old East India Company lost its
claim against the New Company by two
parliamentary votes; and this measure
was passed in the absence of friendly
members who had been seduced from
their posts by the unwonted spectacle
of a tiger-baiting. In 1818 Christopher
North (black be his memory!) described
graphically and with smothered glee the
ignoble game of cat-worrying, which
ran counter to British sporting instincts,
to the roughly interpreted fair play
which severed brutality from baseness.
There was never a time when some English
voice was not raised to protest
against that combination of cruelty and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
cowardice which pitted strength against
weakness, or overwhelming odds against
pure gallantry of spirit. The first Englishman
to assert that animals had a
right to legal protection was John Evelyn.
He grasped this novel point of
view through sheer horror and disgust
because a stallion had been baited with
dogs in London, and had fought so
bravely that the dogs could not fasten
on him until the men in charge ran him
through with their swords. Evelyn
asked, and asked in vain, that the law
should intervene to punish such barbarity.</p>

<p>A century later we hear the same
cry of indignation, the same appeal for
pity and redress. This time it comes
from Horace Walpole, who is beside
himself with fury because some scoundrels
at Dover had roasted a fox alive,
to mark—with apt symbolism—their
disapproval of Charles Fox. Walpole,
whom Lord Minto characterized as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
“a prim, precise, pretending, conceited
savage, but a most un-English one,”
demonstrated on this occasion the alien
nature of his sympathies by an outbreak
of rage against the cruelty which
he was powerless to punish. It is interesting
to note that he denounced the
deed as “a savage meanness which an
Iroquois would have scorned”; showing
that he and Lord Minto regarded savagery
from different angles. So, it will
be remembered, did Lord Byron and
Izaak Walton. When the former dared
to call the latter “a sentimental savage,”
he brought down upon his own head,
“bloody but unbowed,” the wrath of
British sportsmen, of British churchmen,
of British sensibility. Even in
far-off America an outraged editor
protested shrilly against this <i>monde
bestorné</i>, this sudden onslaught of vice
upon virtue, this reversal of outlawry
and order.</p>

<p>The effrontery of the attack startled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
a decorous world. Lord Byron had so
flaunted his immoralities that he had
become the scapegoat of society. He
had been driven forth from a pure, or at
least respectable, island, to dally with
sin under less austere skies. The household
virtues shuddered at his name.
Izaak Walton, on the contrary, had
been recognized in his day as a model of
domestic sobriety. He had lived happily
with two wives (one at a time), and had
spent much of his life “in the families of
the eminent clergymen of England, of
whom he was greatly beloved.” He was
buried in Winchester Cathedral, where
English fishermen erected a statue to
commemorate his pastime. His bust
adorns the church of Saint Mary, Stafford,
where he was baptized. His second
wife sleeps under a monument in
Worcester Cathedral. Dr. Johnson and
Wordsworth—great sponsors of morality—united
in his praise. Mr. Lang
(an enthusiastic angler) pronounced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
him to be “a kind, humorous, and pious
soul.” Charles Lamb, who thought
angling a cruel sport, wrote to Wordsworth,
“Izaak Walton hallows any page
in which his reverend name appears.”</p>

<p>This admirable Crichton, this honoured
guest of “eminent clergymen,”
was the man whom Byron—who had
never so much as supped with a curate—selected
to attack in his most scandalously
indecent poem. His lilting
lines,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The quaint, old, cruel coxcomb in his gullet</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Should have a hook, and a small trout to pull it,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p0">were ribald enough in all conscience; but,
by way of superdefiance, he added a
perfectly serious note in which he
pointed out the deliberate character of
Walton’s inhumanity. The famous passage
in “The Compleat Angler,” which
counsels fishermen to use the impaled
frog as though they loved him,—“that
is, harm him as little as you may possibly,
that he may live the longer,”—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
the less famous, but equally explicit,
passages which deal with the
tender treatment of dace and snails,
sickened Byron’s soul, especially when
topped off by the most famous passage
of all: “God never did make a more
calm, quiet, innocent recreation than
fishing.” The picture of the Almighty
smiling down on the pangs of his irrational
creatures, in sportsmanlike sympathy
with his rational creature (who
could recite poetry and quote the Scriptures)
was more than Byron could bear.
He was keenly aware that he offered no
shining example to the world; but he had
never conceived of God as a genial
spectator of cruelty or of vice.</p>

<p>Therefore this open-eyed sinner
called the devout and decent Walton a
sentimental savage. Therefore he wrote
disrespectful words about the “cruel,
cold, and stupid sport of angling.”
Therefore he said, “No angler can be
a good man”; which comprehensive remark<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
caused the public to ask tartly—and
not unreasonably—who appointed
Lord Byron to be its monitor? The fantastic
love of animals, which was one of
the poet’s most engaging traits, may
have been deepened by his resentment
against men. Nevertheless, we recognize
it as a genuine and generous sentiment,
ennobling and also amusing, as most
genuine and generous sentiments are
apt to be. The eaglet that he shot on the
shore of Lepanto, and whose life he
vainly tried to save, was the last bird to
die by his hand. He had an embarrassing
habit of becoming attached to wild
animals and to barnyard fowls. An ungrateful
civet-cat, having bitten a footman,
escaped from bondage. A goose,
bought to be fattened for Michaelmas,
never achieved its destiny; but was
raised to the dignity and emoluments of
a household pet, and carried about in a
basket, swung securely under the poet’s
travelling carriage. These amiable eccentricities<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
won neither respect nor
esteem. Byron could not in cold blood
have hurt anything that breathed; but
there was a general impression that a
man who was living with another man’s
wife had no business to be so kind to
animals, and certainly no business to
censure respectable and church-going
citizens who were cruel to them.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the battle so inauspiciously
begun has been waged ever
since, and has found more impeccable
champions. It was possible for Charles
Lamb to sigh with one breath over
the “intolerable pangs” inflicted by
“meek” anglers, and to rejoice with
the next over the page hallowed by the
angler’s reverend name. Happily for
himself and for his readers, he had that
kind of a mind. But Huxley, whose
mind was singularly inflexible and unaccommodating,
refused such graceful
concessions. All forms of cruelty were
hateful to him. Of one distinguished and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
callous vivisector he said plainly that he
would like to send him to the treadmill.
But he would hear no word against vivisection
from gentlemen who angled with
live bait, and he expressed this unsportsmanlike
view in his “Elementary Lessons
in Physiology.” Mr. Arthur Christopher
Benson’s piteous lines on a little
dace, whose hard fate it is to furnish
an hour’s “innocent recreation” for an
angler, had not then been written; but
Huxley needed no such incentive to
pity. No man in England reverenced
the gospel of amusement less than he
did. No man was less swayed by sentiment,
or daunted by ridicule.</p>

<p>When Hazlitt wrote, “One rich
source of the ludicrous is distress with
which we cannot sympathize from its
absurdity or insignificance,” he touched
the keynote of unconcern. Insignificant
distress makes merry a humane world.
“La malignité naturelle aux hommes est
le principe de la comédie.” Distress<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
which could be forced to appear absurd
made merry a world which had not been
taught the elements of humanity. The
elaborate jests which enlivened the
Roman games were designed to show
that terror and pain might, under rightly
conceived circumstances, be infinitely
amusing. When the criminal appointed
to play the part of Icarus lost his wings
at the critical moment which precipitated
him into a cage of hungry bears,
the audience appreciated the humour of
the situation. It was a good practical
joke, and the possible distaste of Icarus
for his rôle lent pungency to the cleverly
contrived performance. “By making
suffering ridiculous,” said Mr. Pater,
“you enlist against the sufferer much
real and all would-be manliness, and do
much to stifle any false sentiment of
compassion.”</p>

<p>Scott, who had a clear perception of
emotions he did not share, gives us in
“Quentin Durward” an apt illustration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
of human suffering rendered absurd by
its circumstances, and made serviceable
by the pleasure which it gives. Louis the
Eleventh and Charles of Burgundy are
fairly healed of rancorous fear and
hatred by their mutual enjoyment of a
man-hunt. The sight of the mock herald,
doubling and turning in mad terror
with the great boar-hounds at his heels,
so delights the royal spectators that the
king, reeling with laughter, catches hold
of the duke’s ermine mantle for support;
the duke flings his arm over the king’s
shoulder; and these mortal enemies are
converted, through sympathy with each
other’s amusement, into something akin
to friendship. When Charles, wiping his
streaming eyes, says poignantly, “Ah,
Louis, Louis, would to God thou wert as
faithful a monarch as thou art a merry
companion!” we recognize the touch
of nature—of fallen nature—which
makes the whole world kin. Ambroise
Paré tells us that at the siege of Metz,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>
in 1552, the French soldiers fastened
live cats to their pikes, and hung them
over the walls, crying, “Miaut, Miaut”;
while the Spanish soldiers shot at the
animals as though they had been popinjays,
and both besiegers and besieged
enjoyed the sport in a spirit of frank
derision.</p>

<p>This simple, undisguised barbarity
lacks one element, intensely displeasing
to the modern mind,—the element of
bad taste. Imperial Rome had no conception
of a slave or a criminal as a being
whose sensations counted, save as
they affected others, save as they afforded,
or failed to afford, a pleasurable
experience to Romans. Human rights
were as remote from its cognizance as animal
rights were remote from the cognizance
of the Middle Ages. The survival
of savagery in man’s heart is terrifying
rather than repellent; it humiliates more
than it affronts. Whatever is natural is
likely to be bad; but it is also likely to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
come within the scope, if not of our
sympathy, at least of our understanding.
Where there is no introspection there is
no incongruity, nothing innately and
sickeningly inhuman and ill-bred.</p>

<p>The most unpleasant record which
has been preserved for us is the long
Latin poem written by Robert Grove,
afterwards Bishop of Chichester, and
printed in 1685. It is dedicated to the
memory of William Harvey, and describes
with unshrinking serenity the
vivisection of a dog to demonstrate
Harvey’s discovery of the circulation of
the blood. Such experiments, made before
the day of anæsthetics, involved
the prolonged agony of the animal used
for experimentation. Harvey appears to
have been a man as remote from pity as
from ferocity. He desired to reach and
to prove a supremely valuable scientific
truth. He succeeded, and there are few
who question his methods. But that a
man should write in detail—and in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
verse—about such dreadful work, that
he should dwell composedly upon the
dog’s excruciating pain, and compliment
the poor beast on the useful part
he plays, goes beyond endurance. Grove,
who had that pretty taste for classicism
so prevalent among English clerics, calls
on Apollo and Minerva to lend Harvey
their assistance, and promises the dog
that (if Apollo and Minerva play their
parts) he will become a second Lycisca,
and will join Procyon and Sirius in the
heavens.</p>

<p>Here is an instance in which a rudimentary
sense of propriety would have
saved a gentleman and a scholar from
insulting the principles of good taste.
It is more agreeable to contemplate the
brutal crowd surrounding a baited bear
than to contemplate this clergyman
writing in the seclusion of his library.
Religion and scholarship have their responsibilities.
The German soldiers who
ravaged Belgium outraged the sentiments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
of humanity; but the German
professors who sat at their desks, alternately
defending and denying these
ravages, outraged, not merely humanity,
but the taste and intelligence of the
world. Theirs was the unpardonable
sin.</p>

<p>Cruelty is as old as life, and will cease
only when life ceases. It has passed its
candid stage long, long ago. It must
now be condoned for its utility, or
laughed at for its fun. Our comic sense,
if less full-blown than of yore, still relishes
its measure of brutality. To write
gaily about the infliction of pain is to
win for it forgiveness. Douglas Jerrold
found something infinitely amusing in
the sensations of the lobster put into a
pot of cold water, and boiled. His description
of the perspiring crustacean,
unable to understand the cause of
its rapidly increasing discomfort, was
thought so laughable that it was reprinted,
as a happy example of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
writer’s humour, in a recently published
volume on Jerrold’s connection
with “Punch.” The same genial spirit
animated an American Senator who
opposed the sentimental exclusion of
egrets from commerce. It was the
opinion of this gallant gentleman that
the Lord created white herons to supply
ornaments “for the hats of our beautiful
ladies”; and having expressed his sympathy
with the designs of Providence,
he proposed in merry mood that we
should establish foundling asylums for
the nestlings deprived of their overdecorated
parents,—as waggish a witticism
as one would want to hear.</p>

<p>When an eminently respectable American
newspaper can be convulsively
funny, or at least can try to be convulsively
funny, over the sale of a horse,
twenty-seven years old, blind, rheumatic,
and misshapen, to a Chicago
huckster for fifteen cents, we have no
need to sigh over our waning sense of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>
humour. The happy thought of calling
the horse Algernon gave a rich twang to
this comic episode, and saved the cheerful
reader from any intrusive sentiment
of pity. When a pious periodical,
published in the interests of a Christian
church, can tell us in a rollicking Irish
story how a farmer, speeding through
the frozen night, empties a bag of
kittens into the snow, and whips up his
horse, pretending playfully that the
“craitures” are overtaking him, we
make comfortably sure that religion
lends itself as deftly as journalism to the
light-hearted drolleries of the cruel.</p>

<p>Novelists, who understand how easy
a thing it is to gratify our humorous
susceptibilities, venture upon doubtful
jests. Mr. Tarkington knows very well
that the spectacle of a boy dismembering
an insect calls for reprobation; but
that if the boy’s experiments can be
described as “infringing upon the domain
of Dr. Carrell,” they make a bid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
for laughter. “Penrod’s efforts—with
the aid of a pin—to effect a transference
of living organism were unsuccessful;
but he convinced himself forever that a
spider cannot walk with a beetle’s legs.”
It is funny to those who relish the fun.
If it does not, as Mr. Pater advises,
make suffering ridiculous, it makes sympathy
ridiculous, as being a thing more
serious than the occasion warrants. The
reader who is not amused tries to forget
the incident, and hurries cheerfully
on.</p>

<p>A more finished example of callous
gaiety, and one which has been more
widely appreciated, may be found in a
story called “Crocker’s Hole,” by Blackmore.
It tells how a young man named
Pike, whom “Providence” had created
for angling (the author is comfortably
sure on this point), caught an old and
wary trout by the help of a new and
seductive bait. The over-wrought, over-coloured
beauty of Blackmore’s style is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
in accord with his highly sophisticated
sense of humour:</p>

<p>“The lover of the rose knows well a
gay, voluptuous beetle, whose pleasure
it is to lie embedded in a fount of beauty.
Deep among the incurving petals of the
blushing fragrance he loses himself in
his joys till a breezy waft reveals him.
And when the sunlight breaks upon his
luscious dissipation, few would have the
heart to oust such a gem from such a
setting. All his back is emerald sparkles;
all his front, red Indian gold, and here
and there he grows white spots to save
the eye from aching. Pike slipped in his
finger, fetched him out, and gave him a
little change of joys by putting a Limerick
hook through his thorax, and
bringing it out between his elytra.
<i>Cetonia aurata</i> liked it not, but pawed
the air very naturally, fluttered his
wings, and trod prettily upon the water
under a lively vibration. He looked
quite as happy, and considerably more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
active than when he had been cradled
in the anthers of a rose.”</p>

<p>The story is an angling story, and it
would be unreasonable to spoil it by
sympathizing with the bait. But there
is something in the painting of the
little beetle’s beauty, and in the amused
description of its pain, which would
sicken a donkey-beating costermonger,
if he were cultivated enough to know
what the author was driving at. It takes
education and an unswerving reverence
for sport to save us from the costermonger’s
point of view.</p>

<p>There are times when it is easier to
mock than to pity; there are occasions
when we may be seduced from blame,
even if we are not won all the way to approval.
Mrs. Pennell tells us in her very
interesting and very candid life of
Whistler that the artist gratified a
grudge against his Venetian landlady by
angling for her goldfish (placed temptingly
on a ledge beneath his window-sill);<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
that he caught them, fried them,
and dropped them dexterously back
into their bowl. It is a highly illustrative
anecdote, and we are more amused than
we have any business to be. Mr. Whistler’s
method of revenge was the method
of the Irish tenants who hocked their
landlord’s cattle; but the adroitness of
his malice, and the whimsical picture
it presents, disarms sober criticism. A
sympathetic setting for such an episode
would have been a comedy played in
the streets of Mantua, under the gay
rule of Francesco Gonzaga, and before
the eyes of that fair Isabella d’Este
who bore tranquilly the misfortunes of
others.</p>

<p>We hear so much about the sanitary
qualities of laughter, we have been
taught so seriously the gospel of amusement,
that any writer, preacher, or
lecturer, whose smile is broad enough
to be infectious, finds himself a prophet
in the market-place. Laughter, we are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
told, freshens our exhausted spirits and
disposes us to good-will,—which is
true. It is also true that laughter quiets
our uneasy scruples and disposes us to
simple savagery. Whatever we laugh at,
we condone, and the echo of man’s
malicious merriment rings pitilessly
through the centuries. Humour which
has no scorn, wit which has no sting,
jests which have no victim, these are not
the pleasantries which have provoked
mirth, or fed the comic sense of a conventionalized
rather than a civilized
world. “Our being,” says Montaigne,
“is cemented with sickly qualities; and
whoever should divest man of the seeds
of those qualities would destroy the
fundamental conditions of life.”</p>
